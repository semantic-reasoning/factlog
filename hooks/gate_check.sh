# factlog PreToolUse gate — deny writes to engine inputs when logic_report.txt
# is absent or stale, EXCEPT for the first (bootstrap) creation of an input.
#
# Fires BEFORE Write|Edit. If the tool is about to touch facts/accepted.dl or
# facts/query.dl, this script checks that facts/logic_report.txt exists and is
# newer than both files. If the predicate fails it exits 2, which Claude Code
# interprets as a permissionDecision=deny and blocks the tool call.
#
# FALSIFIABLE predicate (per CRITIC M4 + bootstrap fix):
#   Let TARGET be the tool target path. TARGET is an "engine input" iff it
#   resolves to <KB_ROOT>/facts/accepted.dl OR <KB_ROOT>/facts/query.dl.
#
#   ALLOW (exit 0) iff any of:
#     A. TARGET is not an engine input; OR
#     B. BOOTSTRAP: facts/logic_report.txt does NOT exist AND TARGET does NOT
#        yet exist on disk (this is the first creation of an engine input in a
#        fresh KB, where no report can possibly exist yet); OR
#     C. FRESH: facts/logic_report.txt EXISTS and is newer than (>=) the most
#        recently modified existing engine input (accepted.dl / query.dl).
#
#   DENY (exit 2) otherwise, i.e. TARGET is an engine input AND NOT bootstrap
#   AND (report absent OR report stale).
#
# This predicate is falsifiable in both directions:
#   - Bootstrap is allowed: creating facts/query.dl in a freshly `factlog init`
#     KB (no logic_report.txt, no pre-existing query.dl) returns exit 0.
#   - Stale-guard still denies: once a logic_report.txt exists, any edit that
#     would supersede it (report absent due to deletion, or report older than
#     an existing input) returns exit 2. Running /factlog check (which calls
#     run_logic_check.py and writes a fresh logic_report.txt) re-satisfies (C).
#
# KB root: set FACTLOG_ROOT to the knowledge-base root for sound path matching;
# falls back to the current working directory when unset.
#
# Fail-closed: if python3 is unavailable or target-path extraction fails for an
# engine-input-shaped payload, the gate denies rather than silently allowing.
