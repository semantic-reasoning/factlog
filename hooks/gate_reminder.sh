# Fires after Write/Edit. If an engine input was just edited by the model, it
# reminds the session to run the deterministic logic check and show the report
# verbatim before concluding — the core factlog rule ("the agent does not draw
# conclusions; the CLI returns the verifiable report").
#
# This is a nudge only. The enforcing version (block conclusions until
# run_logic_check.py has run and logic_report.txt is shown) is authored in the
# delivery plan (T3) using a PreToolUse deny on the relevant action. A Stop hook
# cannot block, so enforcement must sit on a tool action, not on completion.
