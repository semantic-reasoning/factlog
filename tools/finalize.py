"""One-shot deterministic finalize for `/factlog add`.

After the in-session extraction step writes runs/*.json, this chains the
deterministic engine steps into a single command so capturing knowledge is
low-friction:

    merge_candidates  ->  ensure policy/logic-policy.dl  ->  check_conflicts
        ->  compile_facts  ->  run_logic_check

The single-valued contradiction gate (check_conflicts) runs BEFORE compile_facts so
a detected contradiction never reaches facts/accepted.dl, the engine's trusted input
that ask/check read directly without recompiling (#212).

It is read-through to the bundled scripts (no logic duplicated here) and prints a
concise summary. The logic check needs pyrewire>=1.0.3; when that is absent the
check is skipped with a clear note (facts are still merged and compiled) so the
command degrades gracefully rather than hard-failing.

Usage:
    python3 finalize.py [--target <kb>]
