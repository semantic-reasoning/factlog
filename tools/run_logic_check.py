    Use this, not ``quoted_constants``, wherever a line is read BEFORE and AFTER
    ``resolve_query_spellings``. That function re-quotes through ``json.dumps``,
    so resolving onto a value that itself carries a ``"`` puts a ``\\"`` into the
    query string; ``quoted_constants``' raw ``"([^"]+)"`` splits on the escape and
    returns a different NUMBER of constants for the same line. Measured on
    ``relation("예산안", R, "amount(1000,億)")?`` over a KB holding
    ``amount(1000,"億")``: ``['amount(1000,億)']`` written against
    ``['amount(1000,\\\\', ')']`` resolved. Every canonical ``amount`` value carries
    a quote — it is the form merge stores — so this is the ordinary case for any
    query naming an amount, not an exotic one.

    Going through ``query_args``/``is_quoted_string``/``arg_value`` decodes with
    ``json.loads`` instead of scanning for quote characters, so the two readings
    match by construction: ``resolve_query_spellings`` rebuilds the line from the
    same argument list, substituting in place.

    Decoding is also what the vocabulary tests want: *entities* is ``value_set``,
    which holds values as the KB decodes them, so a query constant must be
    compared decoded rather than as the raw text between quotes.

    NOT a drop-in replacement for ``quoted_constants`` everywhere. It sees
    arguments, so a line that does not parse as an atom, or whose argument does
    not parse as one quoted string, yields nothing where the regex still returned
    text. Every caller here reads a line ``query_error`` has already accepted.

    Neither rule is restated here: ``common.query_arity_error`` and
    ``common.query_shape_error`` are the same two functions ``classify_query``
    applies, in the same order, so the gate and the report cannot disagree about
    which lines are answerable nor word the verdict differently. They used to, on
    every predicate:

    - ``count`` was checked on ARITY ONLY, so ``count("S", 'r')?`` reached
      ``evaluate_queries``, where a non-double-quoted argument is treated as a
      WILDCARD rather than a filter. The count then ranged over every relation of
      that subject and was printed as an engine-verified aggregate (#328). An
      aggregate is the output a reader is least able to check by eye, which is
      why answering it wrongly is worse than not answering it.
    - a policy query was checked on arity only, so ``stale_entity(Alice, stale)?``
      had both bare tokens taken for variables and rendered the predicate's WHOLE
      extent with invented bindings (``Alice=Bob``).
    - ``relation`` and ``path`` were checked on NEITHER rule — they fell through
      to the generic warning loop. Same mechanism, wider blast radius:
      ``relation("Marie Curie", 'born_in', O)?`` reported rows spanning every
      relation of the subject, each carrying a nonsense binding
      (``'born_in'=worked_at``), and an arity violation was answered as a
      confident NEGATIVE about a fact that is in the KB:

          relation("Marie Curie", "born_in", "Warsaw", X)?
            gate   -> bad_arity
            report -> relation results: 0 rows
          path("Marie Curie", "Warsaw", "Poland")?
            gate   -> bad_arity
            report -> path Marie Curie -> Warsaw: Marie Curie -> Warsaw

      A dropped extra argument is a plausible typo, and both answers read as
      engine-verified.

    ARITY IS CHECKED FIRST, which is not interchangeable with the other order:
    it decides the DIAGNOSIS a line that breaks both rules receives. Shape-first
    told the author of ``relation()?`` that "arguments must be variables or
    quoted strings" — advice about the quoting of arguments that are not there.

    One verdict serves both the Errors section (``validate_query``) and the
    answer renderers (``evaluate_queries``, ``policy_result_line``), so the
    report cannot call a line an error and answer it in the same run.

    Message wording is the gate's, with the offending line appended — the
    convention every other error in this module follows, ``one_line`` included:
    the appended text is the RAW query line, not a decoded value, and the raw
    line is its own carrier (see ENGINE_FAILED_STATUS_LINE).

    #     the ``\"`` that ``json.dumps`` wrote — so the floor picks the wrong list
    #     and the bug comes straight back. The regex is not merely incomplete on
    #     escaped text; it is wrong in BOTH directions, which is why it cannot
    #     serve as a floor, a ceiling or a cross-check anywhere.
    #   - "regex on the written side, parser on the resolved side", which does fix
    #     the amount case. It desyncs on an EMPTY literal instead: the regex drops
    #     ``""`` and the parser keeps it, so ``relation("a", "r", "")?`` reads 2

    """Zip a line's constants with the same line's after spelling resolution:
    ``(what the author wrote, what to test against the KB vocabulary)``.

    When the lists disagree in length a diagnostic must not be attributed to the
    wrong constant, so this ABANDONS RESOLUTION for the line and pairs each
    constant with itself — the unresolved reading, which is the pre-existing
    behaviour, so the fallback can only warn where the old code warned.

    **This branch used to be documented as unreachable, and it fired.** The
    argument given was "resolution substitutes in place and never adds or drops
    an argument", which is true — and did not apply, because the callers were not
    counting arguments. Two of them scanned the line with ``quoted_constants``'
    raw ``"([^"]+)"``, which cannot see JSON escaping, while
    ``resolve_query_spellings`` re-quotes through ``json.dumps``. Resolving onto
    any value that itself carries a ``"`` therefore changed the COUNT of what the
    regex found, and every canonical ``amount`` value carries one. The reader who
    trusted the sentence would have looked for a mistake in the substitution and
    found none.

    Every caller now reads both sides with ``query_constants``, and the reason
    the branch does not fire is the one the old sentence claimed: the resolved
    line is REBUILT from ``query_args(line)`` with per-position substitutions that
    preserve "this argument is a quoted string", so re-parsing it yields the same
    number of constants by construction. Measured over 300k generated lines
    against a map that actually moves constants: of the 23002 that were rewritten,
    the regex reading disagreed on 14720 and the parser reading on 0.

    So the branch is kept, and the invariant it now guards is narrower and
    stated where it can be checked: **both sides must be read by the same
    parser.** That is the thing that broke, not arity. A caller that reaches for
    ``quoted_constants`` here again, or hands in two lists produced by different
    readers, lands in this fallback — silently, since it degrades rather than
    raises. It is also a module-level helper with no guard on its arguments, so
    "unreachable" was never a property of the function, only of its callers.

    ``common.classify_query``'s ``_shown`` guard degrades the same way for the
    same reason. The two were written pointing in opposite directions — one
    reverting the display, the other the evaluation — which would have made a
    desync produce a gate and a report that disagree about the same line.

    Three sites read the resolved line by direct index instead, and they do NOT
    behave alike on a desync. Measured, one at a time:

    * the ``count`` branch of ``evaluate_queries`` — ``subj_q, rel_q =
      query_args(resolved)`` RAISES ``ValueError`` on any arity but 2. Loud, at
      every mismatch.
    * ``validate_query``'s policy branch — ``query_args(resolved)[0]`` raises
      ``IndexError``, but TWO conditions must both hold, and neither alone is
      enough. The resolved line must not parse as an atom at all, *and* the
      WRITTEN argument 0 must be a quoted string: the operand sits behind
      ``is_quoted_string(args[0]) and …``, so a variable there short-circuits it
      away and the same unparseable resolved line raises nothing. Measured:

          resolved does not parse, written arg0 quoted   -> IndexError
          resolved does not parse, written arg0 variable -> errors=[] warnings=[]

      A resolved line that DOES parse, with the wrong arity, still has an index 0
      and passes through silently — ``needs_review()?`` yields ``['']``, so the
      membership test asks about the empty constant and the warning that comes out
      names the WRITTEN constant, ``query references non-engine entity: Alice``.
      Worth saying precisely at a site whose whole subject is which constant a
      message names: the empty string drives the verdict, the written one is
      printed.
    * ``policy_result_line``'s ``filter_args`` — **never raises.**
      ``policy_row_matches`` iterates ``enumerate(args)`` behind an
      ``index >= len(row)`` guard and returns False, and the binding loop is
      ``zip(..., strict=False)``. A resolved line carrying one extra argument
      turns a real answer into a verified negative in silence:

          correct   : needs_review results (…): 1 rows; R=stale
          on desync : needs_review results (…): 0 rows

    So the site that fails most quietly is the one this docstring used to promise
    would surface a desync loudest. The count branch is the only unconditional
    raise. If ``resolve_query_spellings`` ever stops preserving arity, that is
    where it surfaces — and ``policy_result_line`` is where it would NOT, which
    makes it the one place an arity guard here would earn its keep. None of the
    three attributes a message to a constant, which is the failure this function
    exists to prevent, so none of them is given one today."""

def policy_row_matches(args: list[str], row: tuple[str, ...] | list[str]) -> bool:
    """True when *row* satisfies every quoted constant *args* pins, by position.

    A quoted constant is a FILTER, at whatever position it appears — not merely a
    binding the display omits. Filtering only args[0] would still let
    ``pred(E, "stale")?`` report the other reasons' rows, and would do so while
    the first-argument form answers correctly, which is worse than filtering
    nothing: the reader loses the one signal that the second line is untrustworthy.

    A row shorter than the pinned position cannot satisfy the constant, so the
    0-arity row an engine may emit is dropped from a constant-pinned query (it
    still shows up for an all-variable query, as before).

    Comparison is SPLIT BY POSITION, and the split is the whole of #383.
    Position 0 compares RAW (``arg_value`` only); every position past it compares
    through ``canonical_value`` — the fold ``ask``'s ``evaluate_relation``
    already uses. Not every query-value comparison folds; still raw, for
    example: this module's ``relation_results`` and count branch, ``ask``'s
    count and path branches, and ``classify_query``'s path and policy gates.
    Those asymmetries are their own matter (#213); what changes here is one.

    Why past-the-first folds. Those positions hold whatever the policy rule put
    there: usually a REASON CODE, but a rule that projects an object
    (``needs_review(S, O) :- relation(S, "대표", O).``) makes it a KB value.
    Folding is right for both, for different reasons.

    For a reason code it closes #383. ``_QUERY_VALUE_POSITIONS`` has no entry
    for a policy predicate, so ``resolve_query_spellings`` treats every position
    as a value and moves the constant onto some KB value's spelling -- while the
    engine carries the code exactly as logic-policy.extra.dl wrote it. Raw
    comparison then missed a row the "Policy evaluation: N rows" extent line
    directly above had already counted: one report saying two things about one
    line, and the second reading as a verified negative.

    For a projected value it is what ``ask``'s ``evaluate_relation`` already
    does, and on any KB the pipeline produces it cannot mix atoms the way
    folding position 0 would. ``canonical_value`` folds two things --
    NFC and ``literal_types.canonical_amount`` -- and a compile already applies
    the FIRST to BOTH axes: ``engine_atom_key`` keys the atom on
    ``(NFC(subject), relation, NFC(object))``, so one value's two normalization
    forms survive a compile at neither position. The second is where the axes
    part: ``merge_candidates`` canonicalises an amount on the OBJECT only, so a
    merged KB's amount-shaped object arrives already canonical while two
    amount-shaped SUBJECTS coexist. That single gap is the asymmetry -- see
    below. That qualifier is load-bearing: the object-side canonicalisation is
    ``merge``'s, not the compile's, so a hand-written ``candidates.csv`` run
    through ``compile_facts`` alone can carry two amount spellings at the object
    -- measured, folding then returns both under one subject. Reaching that
    needs hand-writing merge's own output, the same class as editing
    ``accepted.dl``; the position-0 gap needs neither.

    Why position 0 does not: it is the entity axis, and ``resolve_query_spellings``
    already aligns it whenever the KB writes that value one way. Folding it
    changes an answer only where resolution was REFUSED -- where accepted.dl
    holds one value in two spellings -- and that is reachable from a plain
    ``compile_facts`` run, not only a hand-edited file: ``merge_candidates``
    canonicalises amounts on the object only, so ``amount(1,000,"억")`` and
    ``amount(1000,"억")`` survive as two subjects sharing one
    ``kb_query_spellings`` key, which that map then refuses. Measured there, a
    folded position 0 answered the query with the asked-for atom's row AND the
    other atom's, indistinguishable because a constant position suppresses its
    binding. ``kb_query_spellings``' docstring rejects exactly that trade
    ("Substituting one atom's facts for another's is worse than the
    unaddressability it was meant to cure"), and ``classify_query``'s policy gate
    compares args[0] raw as well, so folding here alone would answer positively
    for an entity the same report warns is not an engine entity.

    The body is kept identical to ask_router's ``policy_row_matches``
    (same body, module-specific docstring) so the report and ``ask``
    cannot diverge, which is the property
    tests/unit/test_policy_query_filter.py pins. The natural home is common.py
    alongside the other query-parsing helpers, but hoisting it there is a wider
    change than this fix needs; the report/router parity test fails if the two
    copies ever drift. Five of its cases carry that load. Do not delete any of
    the five, and re-measure rather than trusting this list:

    * ``test_zero_arity_row_is_dropped_by_both_paths``
    * ``test_nfd_stored_entity_does_not_meet_an_nfc_query_on_either_path``
    * ``test_position_0_is_not_folded_on_either_path``
    * ``test_a_reason_code_in_the_other_normal_form_meets_the_row_on_both_paths``
    * ``test_position_1_folds_the_way_canonical_value_does_not_merely_nfc``

    The drifts they exist for: a copy that loses the short-row guard, folds
    position 0 as well, drops the fold past the first position, drops that
    filter altogether (#326 again), or reaches for ``unicodedata.normalize``
    instead of ``canonical_value``. Which case catches which is not fixed here
    on purpose -- the mapping is not one-to-one and it moves when cases are
    added, so a claim about it goes stale silently. Run the drift and read the
    failures.

    answered:

    - unparseable (no trailing '?'): `query_args` returns [], no constant is
      pinned, so the filter passes everything -> the whole extent;
    - `pred()?` -> one empty arg, likewise unfiltered -> the whole extent;
    - `pred("Alice")?` / `pred("Alice", R, "zzz")?` -> wrong arity, filtered by
      whatever constants happen to line up -> a plausible but meaningless count;
    - `pred(Alice, stale)?` -> right arity, but neither bare token is a variable
      or a quoted string, so `policy_row_matches` pins nothing and every row is
      rendered against them: the whole extent again, this time with `Alice=Bob`
      bindings that name an entity the row is not about (#328).

    "No usable args" is not "no constants to honour" — it means the query was
    never understood, so answering it invents an answer for a line the report is
    simultaneously calling an error. Emitting nothing leaves the Errors section
    to speak. ask_router.evaluate raises NotImplementedError on the same shapes,
    so neither path answers a malformed policy query.

    The query is echoed ONLY when a quoted constant is pinned. Such a line and
    the "Policy evaluation:" extent line ("<pred>: N rows", the count over ALL
    entities) sit a few lines apart and now legitimately disagree — 3 rows there,
    0 rows here — so naming the query that produced the 0 is what makes the pair
    readable as scope rather than contradiction, and it tells two queries on the
    same predicate apart. A variable-only query cannot produce that mismatch (it
    reports the extent, which is what the extent line says), so it keeps its
    original text byte for byte — the query-shape whose output this fix promised
    not to change. The extent line itself is left untouched: it is pinned by

            #   - the `review_required` question echo is query-derived and now
            #     passes through `json.loads`; an escaped C0 value therefore
            #     reaches rendering as a real control character even though its
            #     physical query line contains only the escape. The `query must
            #     end with ?` error fires before that parser guard, so raw C0 can
            #     still reach it directly.
            #   - the path trace nodes are NOT query-derived at all. They come out
            #     of `dependency_path` over the FACTS (see the comment at the trace
            #     itself), so their carrier is the facts decoder, not query.dl, and

# The line that tells a reader — and hooks/gate_check.sh — that this report
# describes a run in which THE ENGINE NEVER RAN. It is the whole discriminator
# between "engine ran and found nothing" and "there is nothing to find out from
# here", so it is matched as a whole line, byte for byte, on both sides. Change
# it in one place only together with the other two: `_records_engine_failure` in
# hooks/gate_check.sh and the same comparison in factlog/cli.py.
#
# The marker is NEGATIVE — a successful report carries no status line at all —
# for one reason: the success report's text is a published contract
# (tests/golden/logic_report.txt, examples/sample-kb/facts/logic_report.txt, and
# every report already sitting in a user's KB), and a positive `status: ok`
# marker would make every one of those read as unrecognised.
#
# A negative marker only works while "carries the marker" and "written by the
# failure path" are the same set, and that is NOT free. This report interpolates
# KB-derived text, and KB text reaches it through two decoders, each of which can
# deliver a newline the file itself does not show:
#
#   - facts/candidates.csv — a quoted CSV field may span physical lines, so a
#     hand-edited status of "odd\nstatus: engine-did-not-run" arrives as a value
#     containing a real newline;
#   - facts/query.dl — `arg_value` is `json.loads`, so `"a\nstatus: ..."` written
#     as ONE physical line, with the escape as two ordinary characters, decodes
#     to the same thing. Splitting the file into lines cannot see it. This is the
#     worst carrier of the three: query.dl is an engine input this very gate
#     guards, and `/factlog query` writes it;
#   - facts/accepted.dl — `common.parse_relation_fact` is `json.loads` too, so a
#     compiled fact carries escapes exactly like a query does, and reaches here
#     through the ordinary pipeline: compile_facts renders a candidates value into
#     dl_string form and this report decodes it back. Covered by display_value and
#     the result renderers, which one_line every value they print.
#
# Whichever the carrier, the run SUCCEEDS, the report carries real counts, and
# both readers then call it an engine failure with `reason: (not recorded)` — the
# deadlock #338 removes, rebuilt out of KB content, and since the status fix
# repeated by two consumers rather than one.
#
# There is a THIRD carrier, and it is not a decoder at all: the RAW query line.
# Every error and echo in this module appends the offending line of
# facts/query.dl verbatim, and `query_lines` splits that file with
# `str.splitlines()`, which consumes line breaks and NOTHING else. NUL, ESC, DEL
# and the C1 range ride through untouched inside one physical line. That cannot
# forge the marker — a forged line needs a break, and a break is the one thing
# splitlines already ate — but it is the same defect with a different victim:
# `zz<ESC>[1A<ESC>[2Kerrors: 0 (all clear)(X)?` in query.dl produces a report
# whose own header says `errors: 1` and whose Errors section, on the terminal
# that SKILL.md Step 3 tells an operator to read it on, renders as
# `errors: 0 (all clear)`. Measured before the wrapping went in. So the raw line
# is wrapped at every site too, and the invariant below is about the report's
# reader as much as its parser.
#
# `one_line` is what keeps the two sets equal, and it has to be at every site
# where a KB-derived value — decoded or raw — reaches a report line; the
# csv-side sites alone left query.dl wide open. The claim to be careful with is
# the one this comment used to make: not "no interpolated value can open a line"
# as a property of the design, but "these call sites are wrapped", which is a
# property of a list and stays true only while the list is complete. tests/unit
# pins one carrier per decoder and one for the raw line; a new interpolation
# site needs its own.
#
# Two sites deliberately interpolate WITHOUT `one_line`, and neither is an
# omission: `policy_result_line` and the relation renderer print a query's
# argument text (`f"{arg}=..."`) only after `_query_shape_error` has passed it,
# and an arg that is not a quoted string must match `[A-Z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` to get
# there. Wrapping them would be a no-op on every value that can reach them.
#
# The cost of the negative marker is also that a report truncated inside its
# first three lines would lose it and read as a success; _write_report closes
# that by replacing the file atomically.

#     did). A value carrying one opens a line for one reader and not for another.
#     U+2028 is routine in text pasted from PDFs — see factlog/common.py's
#     line-break handling.
#   - OTHER C0/C1 CONTROLS, above all NUL. A report line is judged by tools that
#     are not all Python, and a NUL made BSD sed abort mid-pipeline; because the
#     gate read that pipeline's status as "no marker", ONE NUL byte in the report
#     turned a DENY into an ALLOW. That is this whole change in reverse — not
#     forging the marker but erasing the reader's ability to see it — so no value
#     reaching a report line may carry one. ESC belongs here too: this report is
#     printed to a terminal.

    `mkstemp` creates at 0600 and `os.replace` carries the SOURCE's mode onto

    report — measured 0644 on origin/main, 0600 here, on the SUCCESS path, every
    run. That is not a cosmetic difference in this hook's company: an unreadable
    report used to fall through to the mtime branch and be allowed, and now

    different UIDs — a devcontainer running the check as root, a CI stage that
    switches user, a group-shared KB — 0600 turns into a blanket refusal of every
    Write/Edit to facts/accepted.dl and facts/query.dl.

    Two cases, and they are not the same rule:

    - the report EXISTS: keep its mode. An operator who chmod'd it 0664 for a
      shared KB did so deliberately, and `write_text` (what origin/main used)
      never disturbed it. This is the case that matters, because it is the one a
      cross-UID setup arrives in.

      `open(..., "w")` would have produced. Read by setting and restoring the
      umask, the only way to observe it; this module is single-threaded by the
      time it writes, and nothing else creates a file inside that window.

    neither report yet passes the gate as one.

    ``newline="\\n"`` is load-bearing, not tidiness. Text mode translates "\\n" to

    and the gate's whole-line match then stops matching, which fails OPEN: it
    hands out edit rights on engine inputs at the moment the engine is broken.
    Measured here by writing a CRLF report by hand (gate exit 0 where LF gives

    Until this existed, an engine that could not start — pyrewire missing or too
    old, facts/accepted.dl absent, a policy program the engine refuses — left
    facts/logic_report.txt *untouched*. Two things followed, and the second is
    the reason this function reports failure rather than staying silent:

    - the previous run's report survived on disk and read as this run's result.
      A reader (and `/factlog check`'s output) had nothing to tell the two
      apart, so a report describing facts that are no longer compiled looked
      current;
    - the gate's freshness predicate had nothing to compare against, so it
      denied every edit to an engine input and pointed at `/factlog check`,
      which is the command that had just failed.

    What this report may and may not say:

    - It states the CAUSE and nothing about the KB. Every count a successful
      report carries (engine facts, policy findings, errors, warnings) is
      OMITTED rather than written as 0 — `engine facts: 0` is a claim that the
      engine ran over an empty KB, which is exactly the sentence this report
      must not produce.
    - It does NOT satisfy the gate. A report of a run that did not happen is not
      evidence that editing facts/accepted.dl or facts/query.dl is safe, so
      ENGINE_FAILED_STATUS_LINE keeps the deny in place — the gate's message
      just changes from "run /factlog check" to the actual cause. Recovery is
      the Bash route in docs/guide/determinism.md, which the hook's Write|Edit
      matcher deliberately leaves open.
    - It does not change the exit code. main re-raises, so `/factlog check`
      still fails and still prints the error on stderr; this file is a side
      effect of failing, never a sign of success.

    *reason* is collapsed to a single line and then escaped like any other
    KB-derived value: the format is line-oriented and judged whole-line on the
    other side, and an engine ParseError's message spans several lines.

    THE REASON LINE IS A CARRIER, and the one the carrier list above did not
    name — it is very nearly the only place KB text enters a FAILURE report. A
    line of facts/accepted.dl the engine refuses goes into the exception message
    verbatim, so whatever that line holds lands here. ``" ".join(split())``
    collapses Python whitespace only, so a NUL rode it into the report intact and
    blinded the gate's reader; ``one_line`` is what closes that, and it is the
    same grade of escaping every other interpolation gets.
