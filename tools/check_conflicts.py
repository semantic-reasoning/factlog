"""Detect contradictions among engine-input facts.

A relation declared *single-valued* (functional) in policy/single-valued.md may
hold at most one object per subject. If two distinct objects are asserted for the
same (subject, relation) among engine-input facts (status confirmed/accepted;
'superseded' rows are ignored), that is a contradiction — the kind of silent rot
a plain notes wiki accumulates. This surfaces it deterministically.

Resolution is human-in-the-loop and non-destructive: mark the outdated row's
status as 'superseded' in facts/candidates.csv (it stays for audit, drops out of
engine input, and the conflict clears).

Exit code: 0 if no conflicts, 1 if any conflict is found.

def _group_key(obj: str, spec: TypedRelSpec | None) -> tuple:
    """Return the equivalence key an *object* string is grouped under.

    For a relation declared typed (#116), the object's canonical scalar
    (``literal_types.normalize``) is the key, so equivalent notations of the same
    value (e.g. ``amount(5400,"억")`` and ``amount(0.54,"조")`` -> 5.4e11) collapse
    to one value instead of firing a false CONFLICT. ``amount`` needs its unit
    table, so ``spec.units`` is passed through.

    Falls back to the raw object string when the relation is untyped OR the value
    does not parse (normalize -> None): backward-compatible, lossless degrade. The
    two key spaces are tagged (``"scalar"`` vs ``"raw"``) so a scalar never
    collides with an unrelated raw string. Total: never raises (normalize is
    total).

    **ordinal unit loss (#218 / #224 A):** ``normalize("ordinal", …)`` keeps only
    the integer *rank* — the ordinal-class unit (호/위/번/차/등/째) is dropped at
    parse time (``literal_types.parse_ordinal``), so it never enters the key. A
    cross-unit pair therefore collapses onto one scalar: ``제3호`` and ``3위`` both
    key as ``("scalar", 3)``. This is **by design** and consistent with the engine,
    which likewise compares ordinals on rank alone (``_TYPED_COL["ordinal"]`` is a
    bare int64, no unit column). ordinal is a *rank-only* contract: same rank =
    same value. If two notations denote genuinely different domains (a rank vs a
    house number), that distinction belongs in the model — declare them as
    **separate relations**, not one single-valued ordinal relation. (Contrast
    ``amount``, where 억↔조 equivalence is the intended collapse.)

    **int64 divergence note (#224 C):** ``normalize`` can return a scalar wider
    than int64 (mainly ``number`` via ``parse_number_scaled``, which has no range
    guard — ``amount`` already degrades to raw when ``parse_amount`` overflows,
    #205). The engine, by contrast, **skips insertion** of an out-of-int64-range
    scalar (see ``insert_typed_facts`` in ``common.py`` ~ the ``-(2**63) <= scalar
    < 2**63`` guard). So this checker may group under a scalar the engine would
    drop. That affects **grouping only** (never insertion) and is harmless: the
    checker is strictly more willing to merge equivalents, never less. No behaviour
    change here — note only."""

    """Map (subject, canonical_relation) -> sorted distinct *display* objects,
    for single-valued relations that hold more than one *distinct value* (a
    contradiction).

    Distinctness is judged on the canonical grouping key (typed scalar when
    available, else the raw string — see ``_group_key``), so equivalent typed
    notations do not false-positive. The reported values, however, preserve the
    original object strings (provenance): each distinct key contributes one
    deterministic representative (the lexicographically smallest raw object seen
    for it). Deterministic; never raises.

    Two grouping subtleties documented on ``_group_key``: ordinal collapses
    cross-unit notations onto the shared rank (rank-only contract, #218/#224 A),
    and a scalar wider than int64 groups here even though the engine skips its
    insertion (harmless grouping-only divergence, #224 C).

    **Alias canonicalization (#227):** when *aliases* is provided (non-empty),
    each row's relation is canonicalized via ``_canonicalize`` before the
    single-valued membership test and before grouping.  This causes surface
    variants that map to the same canonical name (e.g. ``게재연도`` and ``발행년도``
    both aliased to ``published_year``) to collide under one key, so a cross-
    variant contradiction is detected as a single conflict on the canonical
    name.  Relations that do **not** participate in the alias map are passed
    through verbatim (no normalization), preserving byte-identical behaviour for
    those predicates.

    When *aliases* is ``None`` or ``{}`` the function is byte-identical to the
    pre-#227 behaviour: the raw relation string is used throughout, and an NFD-
    authored relation name is reported exactly as written (no silent NFC coercion
    for non-participating relations).

    **Typed-spec lookup (#210):** the ``typed`` dict is keyed by NFC-normalized
    names (``typed_relations`` normalizes at ``common._parse_typed_relations``).
    The lookup first tries the canonical relation name (already NFC when it came
    from the alias map), then falls back to the NFC form of the raw relation
    string.  This ensures that an NFD-authored relation that also participates in
    the alias map still reaches its typed spec, so equivalent notations (억↔조)
    collapse correctly."""
