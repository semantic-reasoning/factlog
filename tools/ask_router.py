"""Deterministic search router for `/factlog ask`.

Given an LLM-drafted candidate Datalog query, decide — by deterministic code,
never by LLM judgment — whether the question is answered by the facts/rule
ENGINE or routed to WIKI exploration, and (for the engine path) evaluate it.

Routing is keyed on the *reason class* returned by
``common.validate_candidate_query`` (NOT a raw boolean):

    ok=True,  predicate != review_required  -> route=engine (positive/negative)
    ok=True,  predicate == review_required  -> route=wiki
    ok=False, reason is fact-absence        -> route=engine, negative=True
                                               (vocabulary accepted, fact absent)
    ok=False, reason is shape/vocabulary    -> route=wiki

A *verified negative* (engine ran, no matching fact/path) is an engine result —
it is NEVER demoted to unverified wiki prose. Conflating "engine says no" with
"cannot express" is the most damaging routing error this module guards against.

The validator is always called with ``load_accepted_facts()`` (engine input
only), never ``load_facts()`` (candidates), so candidate vocabulary cannot leak
into the engine path.

This module is READ-ONLY with respect to engine inputs: it never writes
``facts/query.dl`` or ``facts/accepted.dl``.

Usage:
    python3 ask_router.py validate "<draft>" [--target <kb>]
    python3 ask_router.py evaluate "<draft>" [--target <kb>]
    python3 ask_router.py render   "<draft>" [--all] [--target <kb>]
    python3 ask_router.py search   "<question>" [--all] [--target <kb>]
    python3 ask_router.py wiki     "<question>" [--all] [--target <kb>]

Each subcommand prints JSON (validate/evaluate) or the rendered answer (render)
to stdout. --target overrides FACTLOG_ROOT (authoritative).

    """Return the fully assembled policy text — the generated `logic-policy.dl`
    PLUS the optional hand-authored `logic-policy.extra.dl` — or '' if no usable
    policy can be assembled yet.

    `/factlog ask` is interactive and must work before `/factlog check` compiles
    `policy/logic-policy.dl`. Reading the *assembled* program via the SAME loader
    `/factlog check` uses — `load_logic_policy()` → `common._load_logic_policy_from`,
    which merges `logic-policy.extra.dl` onto the compiled base — is the single
    source of truth, so ask and check never drift on what the policy program IS.
    That loader already merges `logic-policy.extra.dl` even when the compiled
    `logic-policy.dl` is ABSENT (#190), so a hand-authored comparison predicate
    that lives ONLY in extra.dl (no compiled .dl, no rules in logic-policy.md) is
    now seen and evaluated here, matching check (#198 — closes the ask≠check gap
    where extra.dl was silently ignored when the .dl was absent, #152/#120).
    Both the classify/route path and the evaluate/render path read this, so one
    source of truth fixes both.

    NON-RAISING by contract (#193): `_load_logic_policy_from` fails loud in a few
    cases (`logic-policy.dl` absent WHILE `logic-policy.md` defines uncompiled
    rules; a `canonical/3` head in the policy text) — the right behavior for the
    `check` verification gate, but ask is exploratory and must never hard-fail.
    We reuse the whole loader and catch `FactlogError` here rather than forking
    just its extra.dl-merge tail (which would duplicate logic and invite drift):
    on a LOAD-STAGE failure this returns '' (no policy applied). The uncompiled-
    but-authored `logic-policy.md` case is still surfaced separately as a warning
    by `_policy_uncompiled` (not silently dropped), so #193's behavior is intact —
    an empty return here + that warning, exactly as before.

    Scope note: this guards only the LOAD stage. The ENGINE-EVALUATION stage
    (`evaluate` -> `common.run_wirelog`) re-loads the policy AND runs pyrewire, so
    a present-but-broken `logic-policy.extra.dl` (an unscaled `number` threshold,
    or a syntax error the loader does not parse) can still fail there — including
    with a NON-`FactlogError` pyrewire exception. That stage is guarded separately
    at the `run_wirelog()` call in `evaluate` (degrading to a `policy_unevaluable`
    signal the render/evaluate commands surface as POLICY_UNEVALUABLE_WARNING),
    because it is a distinct failure surface this loader helper never reaches.

    A quoted constant is a FILTER, at whatever position it appears. This branch
    used to test args[0] only, so `pred(E, "stale")?` returned the whole extent
    and `pred("Carol", "low_conf")?` returned Carol's row under a reason that is
    not hers — a fabricated positive for the exact pair the user asked about.

    A row shorter than the pinned position cannot satisfy the constant, so the
    0-arity row an engine may emit is dropped from a constant-pinned query (an
    all-variable query still returns it).

    Comparison is SPLIT BY POSITION, and the split is the whole of #383.
    Position 0 compares RAW (``arg_value`` only); every position past it compares
    through ``canonical_value``, the same fold this module's
    ``evaluate_relation`` uses. Not every query-value comparison folds; still
    raw, for example: the count and path branches here, and
    ``classify_query``'s path and policy gates. Those asymmetries are their own
    matter (#213); what changes here is one.

    Why past-the-first folds. Those positions hold whatever the policy rule put
    there: usually a REASON CODE, but a rule that projects an object
    (``needs_review(S, O) :- relation(S, "대표", O).``) makes it a KB value.
    Folding is right for both, for different reasons.

    For a reason code it closes #383. ``_QUERY_VALUE_POSITIONS`` has no entry
    for a policy predicate, so ``resolve_query_spellings`` treats every position
    as a value and moves the constant onto some KB value's spelling -- while the
    engine carries the code exactly as logic-policy.extra.dl wrote it. Raw
    comparison then missed a row the "Policy evaluation: N rows" extent line
    directly above had already counted: one report saying two things about one
    line, and the second reading as a verified negative.

    For a projected value it is what this module's ``evaluate_relation``
    already does, and on any KB the pipeline produces it cannot mix atoms the
    way folding position 0 would. ``canonical_value`` folds two things --
    NFC and ``literal_types.canonical_amount`` -- and a compile already applies
    the FIRST to BOTH axes: ``engine_atom_key`` keys the atom on
    ``(NFC(subject), relation, NFC(object))``, so one value's two normalization
    forms survive a compile at neither position. The second is where the axes
    part: ``merge_candidates`` canonicalises an amount on the OBJECT only, so a
    merged KB's amount-shaped object arrives already canonical while two
    amount-shaped SUBJECTS coexist. That single gap is the asymmetry -- see
    below. That qualifier is load-bearing: the object-side canonicalisation is
    ``merge``'s, not the compile's, so a hand-written ``candidates.csv`` run
    through ``compile_facts`` alone can carry two amount spellings at the object
    -- measured, folding then returns both under one subject. Reaching that
    needs hand-writing merge's own output, the same class as editing
    ``accepted.dl``; the position-0 gap needs neither.

    Why position 0 does not: it is the entity axis, and ``resolve_query_spellings``
    already aligns it whenever the KB writes that value one way. Folding it
    changes an answer only where resolution was REFUSED -- where accepted.dl
    holds one value in two spellings -- and that is reachable from a plain
    ``compile_facts`` run, not only a hand-edited file: ``merge_candidates``
    canonicalises amounts on the object only, so ``amount(1,000,"억")`` and
    ``amount(1000,"억")`` survive as two subjects sharing one
    ``kb_query_spellings`` key, which that map then refuses. Measured there, a
    folded position 0 answered the query with the asked-for atom's row AND the
    other atom's, indistinguishable because a constant position suppresses its
    binding. ``kb_query_spellings``' docstring rejects exactly that trade
    ("Substituting one atom's facts for another's is worse than the
    unaddressability it was meant to cure"), and ``classify_query``'s policy gate
    compares args[0] raw as well, so folding here alone would answer positively
    for an entity the same report warns is not an engine entity.

    The body is kept identical to run_logic_check's ``policy_row_matches``
    (same body, module-specific docstring) so the report and ``ask``
    cannot diverge, which is the property
    tests/unit/test_policy_query_filter.py pins. The natural home is common.py
    alongside the other query-parsing helpers, but hoisting it there is a wider
    change than this fix needs; the report/router parity test fails if the two
    copies ever drift. Five of its cases carry that load. Do not delete any of
    the five, and re-measure rather than trusting this list:

    * ``test_zero_arity_row_is_dropped_by_both_paths``
    * ``test_nfd_stored_entity_does_not_meet_an_nfc_query_on_either_path``
    * ``test_position_0_is_not_folded_on_either_path``
    * ``test_a_reason_code_in_the_other_normal_form_meets_the_row_on_both_paths``
    * ``test_position_1_folds_the_way_canonical_value_does_not_merely_nfc``

    The drifts they exist for: a copy that loses the short-row guard, folds
    position 0 as well, drops the fold past the first position, drops that
    filter altogether (#326 again), or reaches for ``unicodedata.normalize``
    instead of ``canonical_value``. Which case catches which is not fixed here
    on purpose -- the mapping is not one-to-one and it moves when cases are
    added, so a claim about it goes stale silently. Run the drift and read the
    failures.

    `evaluate` with one. The documented `evaluate` subcommand does: cmd_evaluate
    calls `evaluate` directly, with no classify in front of it — the asymmetry
    that made the first arity guards necessary (#257, 1bc172a). The two codes are
    routed identically (see the "any shape/vocabulary failure" branch in
    `classify`), so there is no basis for guarding one and not the other.

    Answering anyway is not merely unverified, it is wrong, and each consumer was
    wrong in its own direction because each used a different predicate to decide
    "is this argument a constant": `is_variable` here, `is_quoted_string` in the
    report. `count("Marie Curie", 'born_in')?` returned count 0 — which reads as
    a verified negative — while `count(Marie Curie, born_in)?` returned 2 by
    coincidence, the bare token happening to equal the stored value (#328).
    On arity, relation and path returned 0 rows for a query the gate rejects:
    `relation("Marie Curie", "born_in", "Warsaw", X)?` denied a fact that IS in
    the KB, because `evaluate_relation` drops a non-3-arity query to [] and an
    empty relation result renders as a verified negative.

    Arity is tested before shape, as in classify_query and run_logic_check: a
    line breaking both rules must get one reason, the same one, from all three.

    NotImplementedError is the same exception the unknown-predicate fallthrough

    verified row, never the certainty of the verdict:

    - A relation row backed by an extracted candidate is annotated with
      '(sources: N, extraction conf: C)' — the distinct-source count and the
      LLM's source->fact *extraction* confidence (a candidate-stage trust signal,
      NOT a confidence in the engine verification) — plus '[stale: source
      missing]' when a backing source has vanished, with backing source path(s)
      listed beneath ('    ← <source>').
    - A relation row with NO backing extraction (no signal entry) carries no
      extraction confidence, so it is marked '[no extraction backing]' rather
      than left ambiguous. Today every relation atom comes from the candidates
      table and no rule derives one, so this only arises when the two are out of
      sync (recompile via /factlog check); it would also cover a future
      rule-derived relation. Either way the verdict stays binary. Note the
      mapping is many-to-one and not a projection: ``dedup_engine_atoms``
      collapses canonically equivalent rows and writes each value in the
      spelling the KB uses for it, so an atom can carry a triple no single
      candidate row did. That is why the lookup folds through
      ``fold_atom_triple`` — a raw one would miss such an atom and report it
      unbacked.

    Non-relation predicates (path/count/policy) pass signals=None and
    annotate_objects=False: their rows are computed by the engine, carry no
    extraction confidence by construction, and are rendered without annotation.
