"""Deterministic search router for `/factlog ask`.

Given an LLM-drafted candidate Datalog query, decide — by deterministic code,
never by LLM judgment — whether the question is answered by the facts/rule
ENGINE or routed to WIKI exploration, and (for the engine path) evaluate it.

Routing is keyed on the *reason class* returned by
``common.validate_candidate_query`` (NOT a raw boolean):

    ok=True,  predicate != review_required  -> route=engine (positive/negative)
    ok=True,  predicate == review_required  -> route=wiki
    ok=False, reason is fact-absence        -> route=engine, negative=True
                                               (vocabulary accepted, fact absent)
    ok=False, reason is shape/vocabulary    -> route=wiki

A *verified negative* (engine ran, no matching fact/path) is an engine result —
it is NEVER demoted to unverified wiki prose. Conflating "engine says no" with
"cannot express" is the most damaging routing error this module guards against.

The validator is always called with ``load_accepted_facts()`` (engine input
only), never ``load_facts()`` (candidates), so candidate vocabulary cannot leak
into the engine path.

This module is READ-ONLY with respect to engine inputs: it never writes
``facts/query.dl`` or ``facts/accepted.dl``.

Usage:
    python3 ask_router.py validate "<draft>" [--target <kb>]
    python3 ask_router.py evaluate "<draft>" [--target <kb>]
    python3 ask_router.py render   "<draft>" [--target <kb>]

Each subcommand prints JSON (validate/evaluate) or the rendered answer (render)
to stdout. --target overrides FACTLOG_ROOT (authoritative).

      cover a future rule-derived relation. Either way the verdict stays binary.

    extraction confidence by construction, and are rendered without annotation.
