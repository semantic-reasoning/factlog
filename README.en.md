> facts + logic — a Claude Code skill that turns markdown sources into **verifiable, source-backed facts**.
> The LLM extracts; a deterministic Datalog/wirelog engine verifies.

## What it is

factlog is a [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) **skill** for keeping a markdown knowledge base honest. It follows one rule:

> The agent does not draw conclusions. The agent produces files and calls a CLI. The CLI returns a verifiable report.

- **The LLM (Claude, in-session) extracts** candidate facts from your `sources/`, drafts Datalog queries from natural-language questions, and attempts limited self-correction.
- **A deterministic engine (wirelog via [pyrewire](https://github.com/semantic-reasoning/PyreWire)) verifies** them — compiling confirmed facts, running the logic check, and surfacing policy findings, conflicts, and `review_required` items.

Anything the model produces is a *candidate* until the engine and a human confirm it.

## Source file formats

`/factlog sync` extracts facts by reading each file under `sources/` **as text,
in-session**. The bundled engine (`merge_candidates.py`) tracks every file as a
source *path* but never parses contents — so a file is only ingested if its text
can be read during extraction. A binary original (e.g. `.docx`) therefore yields
no facts on its own.

| Format | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `.md`, `.markdown`, `.txt` | **Directly supported** | UTF-8 text, read verbatim. This is what every extraction reference assumes. |
| Other UTF-8 text (`.rst`, `.org`, `.csv`, source code) | Supported as plain text | No special parsing; treated as raw text. |
| `.docx`, binary `.pdf`, `.odt`, `.epub`, `.html`, `.rtf` | **Auto-converted** | `factlog ingest` converts these to text via pandoc / textutil / pdftotext. |
| `.hwpx` (Hancom OWPML) | **Auto-converted** | Built-in extractor (no external tool) — reads the zip's `Contents/section*.xml` text. |
| `.hwp` (legacy Hancom, HWP 5.x) | **Auto-converted** | Via `hwp5html` (pyhwp) → pandoc → markdown, tables preserved. Needs `pip install pyhwp` + pandoc; if absent, reported with a hint. |
| `.pptx` (PowerPoint) | **Auto-converted** | Built-in extractor (no external tool) — reads on-slide text from the zip's `ppt/slides/slideN.xml`, slides in order, one block per slide. Speaker notes are excluded; table cells flatten to one line per cell (row/column grouping not preserved). |
| `.xlsx`, images | **Not converted** | No bundled converter — reported with a hint; convert by hand. |

`factlog ingest` writes the converted text into the KB's **`runs/sources/`**
directory (alongside the other generated run artifacts) — **never into
`sources/`**, which stays the user's originals. A nested original mirrors its
subdirectory (`sources/sub/report.pdf` → `runs/sources/sub/report.md`), so
same-stem files in different folders never collide. The original is left
untouched and the conversion carries a provenance header (source, converter,
date). Both `sources/` and `runs/sources/` are valid source roots that
extraction reads.

> **Upgrading:** subdirectory mirroring is newer than the original flat layout.
> A KB ingested earlier has flat conversions (`runs/sources/report.md`) for
> nested originals; those no longer pair, so a nested binary may reappear as a
> coverage/`factlog sources` gap. Re-run `factlog ingest --scan --force` to move
> conversions to their mirrored paths (then delete any stale flat conversions).
> Top-level (non-nested) sources are unaffected.

```bash
factlog ingest report.docx --target ~/wiki   # → ~/wiki/runs/sources/report.md (pandoc)
factlog ingest --scan --target ~/wiki        # auto-convert every binary under sources/
```

### Active KB (target the set-up KB from anywhere)

After `factlog init`/`setup` (or `factlog use <kb>`), the chosen KB is recorded
as the **active KB**, so `ingest`/`ask`/`sync` and the tools target it from any
working directory — no `--target`/`--wiki` needed:

```bash
factlog use ~/wiki        # make ~/wiki the active KB (recorded in config)
factlog where             # show the active KB and how it was resolved
factlog sources           # list registered sources (original, conversion, fact count)
factlog status            # KB state: facts by status, vocabulary, conflicts, logic freshness, engine
cd /anywhere && factlog ingest report.pdf   # → ~/wiki/runs/sources/report.txt
factlog eject report.pdf  # inverse of ingest: remove the conversion + retire its facts
factlog ignore drafts/*.md   # exclude sources from sync (re-extraction)
factlog provenance Acme uses FastAPI   # trace a fact to its source(s)
```

### Discovering the vocabulary (`factlog vocab`)

`ask` and `provenance` need exact entity/relation names. `factlog vocab` lists
them — the entity and relation names with usage counts — so you know what is
queryable:

```bash
factlog vocab              # entities + relations (engine facts)
factlog vocab --entities   # just entities
factlog vocab --relations  # just relations (tagged [attribute] / [single-valued])
factlog vocab --all        # include non-engine names (candidate/needs_review/superseded)
```

Objects of declared attribute relations are literals, not entities, so they are
excluded from the entity list (same typing as `status`).

### Finding facts (`factlog search`)

When you don't know the exact name, `factlog search <term>` does a
case-insensitive substring match across subject / relation / object and lists
the matching facts (with status and source count). `vocab` lists names,
`search` finds facts by a fragment, `provenance` traces an exact triple.

```bash
factlog search fastapi   # case-insensitive; matches 'FastAPI'
factlog search acme      # partial — every fact mentioning the fragment
```

### Tracing a fact to its source (`factlog provenance`)

Every fact records the source it was extracted from. `factlog provenance` (alias
`trace`) lists, for a matching fact, every backing row — **source path, status,
confidence, the note (extracted excerpt), and a `[stale]` marker** when the
source file is missing on disk. All statuses are shown (including
`superseded`/`needs_review`), so retired backing stays visible.

```bash
factlog provenance Acme uses FastAPI   # exact triple
factlog provenance Acme uses           # all objects for (subject, relation)
factlog provenance Acme                # all facts about a subject
factlog provenance - uses              # relation only ('-' wildcards a position)
factlog provenance - - FastAPI         # object only
```

Positional terms are a `(subject, relation, object)` prefix; a literal `-`
wildcards that position and omitted trailing positions are wildcards too (at
least one non-wildcard term is required). Quote a term that contains spaces.

`/factlog ask` also lists each backing source path (`← <source>`) beneath a
verified engine answer, so a fact found via a query can be traced inline.

### Reviewing facts (`factlog review` / `accept` / `reject`)

Extraction marks facts `candidate` or `needs_review`; only `confirmed`/`accepted`
facts become engine input. Promote or retire them without hand-editing
`facts/candidates.csv`:

```bash
factlog review                       # list the pending queue (candidate + needs_review)
factlog review --status needs_review # narrow to one pending status
factlog accept Acme uses FastAPI     # pending → accepted (compiled into accepted.dl)
factlog accept Acme                  # accept every pending fact about a subject ('-' wildcards a position)
factlog reject Acme uses Datadog     # pending → superseded (retired, kept for audit)
factlog accept Acme uses FastAPI --dry-run
```

`accept`/`reject` change **only pending rows**; a `confirmed`/`accepted`/
`superseded` match is reported and left untouched (use `factlog eject` to retire
a non-pending fact). Both recompile `accepted.dl`.

To **correct** a fact's value (not just its status), use `factlog amend`:

```bash
factlog amend Widget codename Draft --set-object Falcon --set-note "name finalized" --accept
factlog amend Acme uses FastApi --set-object FastAPI    # fix a typo
```

The positional triple identifies the fact (exact match); `--set-subject` /
`--set-relation` / `--set-object` / `--set-note` give the new values (at least
one, or `--accept`). amend updates **both** `candidates.csv` and the backing
`runs/*.json` so the edit survives `/factlog sync` (a fact's value lives in
`runs/*.json` — merge rebuilds `candidates.csv` from it). `--accept` also
promotes to `accepted`. Confidence is not editable. `--dry-run` previews.

> **Durability:** a human `accept` (and `amend --accept`) is preserved across
> re-merge the same way `reject`/`superseded` is — `/factlog sync` will not
> revert your decisions.

### Excluding sources from sync (`factlog ignore`)

`/factlog sync` re-extracts **every** source on each run. To keep specific
sources out of that — a draft, a work-in-progress, an external doc — add them to
the per-KB **sync-ignore list** (`policy/sync-ignore.md`). Ignored sources are
skipped by `/factlog sync`, `factlog ingest --scan`, and coverage gap reporting,
**even when modified**. Their already-merged facts are kept untouched (use
`factlog eject` to actually remove a fact).

```bash
factlog ignore drafts/*.md sources/wip-notes.md   # add pattern(s)
factlog ignore                                     # list patterns + what they match
factlog ignore --remove drafts/*.md               # remove a pattern
```

`policy/sync-ignore.md` is one glob per line (same lenient format as the other
policy files — `#` comments, `-` bullets, backtick-quoted entries; quote a
pattern that starts with `#` in backticks). A pattern matches a source by its
full ref (`sources/...` / `runs/sources/...`) or by its path within the source
root. Glob semantics: `*` and `?` stay within one path segment (do **not** cross
`/`), `**` crosses segments, and a trailing `/` means the whole subtree:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `drafts/*.md` | `sources/drafts/x.md` — but not `sources/drafts/sub/x.md` |
| `drafts/**` (or `drafts/`) | everything under `sources/drafts/` |
| `**/*.md` | any `.md` at any depth |

`factlog sources` marks ignored sources `[ignored]` and coverage reports them as
`excluded` rather than gaps.

### Removing a source (`factlog eject`) — the inverse of `ingest`

`factlog eject <source>` undoes an ingest: it deletes the `runs/sources/`
conversion, strips the source's extracted rows from `runs/*.json`, and retires
the facts that cite it. Name a source by filename, stem, or KB-relative path —
naming the binary original (e.g. `report.pdf`) also matches its
`runs/sources/<stem>` conversion; a bare stem matches every source with that
stem.

```bash
factlog eject report.pdf                 # delete conversion; mark citing facts superseded (kept for audit)
factlog eject report.pdf --purge         # delete the citing candidate rows instead of superseding them
factlog eject report.pdf --delete-original  # also delete the user's original under sources/
factlog eject report.pdf --dry-run       # show the planned changes, modify nothing
```

#### Removing a single fact (`--fact`)

When a source is fine but one extracted fact is wrong, retire just that fact —
the source's conversion and original stay in place:

```bash
factlog eject --fact "을서비스" "정식_운영" "2030.1"      # retire one fact (mark superseded)
factlog eject --fact "갑봇" "통합" "을서비스" --fact "값가" "대체" "값나"   # several at once
factlog eject --fact "을서비스" "정식_운영" "2030.1" --purge   # delete the candidate row instead
```

A fact is matched by its `(subject, relation, object)` triple across **all**
sources. The default `superseded` keeps `runs/*.json` untouched, so the
retirement is durable — a later `/factlog sync` re-asserts the fact from its
source but `merge_candidates` keeps it superseded. `--purge` instead deletes the
row and strips it from `runs/*.json`; if the source still asserts it, a re-sync
re-extracts it, so use the default to retire a fact for good. Fact mode and
source mode are mutually exclusive, and `--delete-original` is not valid with
`--fact`.

By default the retired facts are marked `superseded` (kept in
`facts/candidates.csv` for audit) and the original under `sources/` is **kept** —
so it would be re-converted on the next `/factlog sync`; pass `--delete-original`
to remove it too. `accepted.dl` is recompiled so the engine input drops the
retired facts immediately.

A `runs/sources/` conversion is tied to the original that produced it via the
ingest provenance header, so even when two originals share a stem,
`eject report.docx` never disturbs `report.pptx`'s conversion. `pages/` are not
regenerated by `eject` — run `/factlog sync` to reconcile them. The default
`superseded` mark is a current-state retire: if you keep a **text** original
under `sources/`, the next `/factlog sync` re-extracts and re-asserts its facts —
to remove a source for good, pass `--purge` and/or `--delete-original`.

Resolution precedence: `--target`/`--wiki` flag > `$FACTLOG_ROOT` > active-KB
config (`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/factlog/config.json`) > current directory.
With no config set, behavior is unchanged (uses the current directory).

`/factlog sync` runs `factlog ingest --scan` as its first step, so binaries you
drop in `sources/` are converted automatically (idempotently — unchanged files
are skipped). If a binary has no `runs/sources/` conversion, `merge_candidates.py`
warns so the silent non-ingestion is visible.

## Requirements

- Python **3.11+** (required by the engine dependency `pyrewire`)
- **pyrewire 1.0.1+** (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Claude Code CLI

## Install

factlog is a **Claude Code plugin**. Install it from this repo's marketplace in a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add semantic-reasoning/factlog
/plugin install factlog@semantic-reasoning
/factlog setup                     # one-shot: deps + doctor + init, in-session
```

`setup` runs `doctor`, installs the engine dependency (`pyrewire`), scaffolds the KB, and re-checks the environment — in one command.

### Local install (development)

To develop against a local clone, register the working tree as the marketplace instead:

```
/plugin marketplace add ~/git/semantic-reasoning/factlog
/plugin install factlog@semantic-reasoning
```

### What `/factlog setup` does

`setup` collapses the previously-separate post-install steps into a single command. Equivalently, by hand:

```bash
pip install -r ~/git/semantic-reasoning/factlog/requirements.txt   # pyrewire>=1.0.1,<2.0
python3 -m factlog doctor          # checks Python 3.11+ and pyrewire
python3 -m factlog init --target ~/wiki   # scaffold the KB layout
```

If your Python is externally managed (PEP 668), pip will refuse to install into it; `setup` prints venv guidance instead of forcing the install. Create and activate a venv, then re-run `setup`:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.factlog-venv && source ~/.factlog-venv/bin/activate
python3 -m factlog setup --target ~/wiki
```

## Usage

In a Claude Code session inside your knowledge base (the plugin is active in every session):

```
/factlog sync      # read sources/, extract candidate facts, update pages & decisions
/factlog query     # translate policy/questions.md into facts/query.dl (Datalog query draft)
/factlog check     # compile accepted facts, run the logic check over accepted + query, show the report
/factlog repair    # attempt gated self-correction of review_required queries
/factlog ask       # answer one question: deterministically routed to the engine (verified) or wiki exploration (unverified)
```

Run `/factlog query` before `/factlog check`: the logic check evaluates the
query draft in `facts/query.dl`, which `/factlog query` produces from your
natural-language questions in `policy/questions.md`.

## Determinism & limitations

A skill is a prompt, so the model is *guided*, not *forced*, to run each step. factlog keeps every step that must be reliable — fact compilation, the wirelog logic check, policy compilation, validation — as **bundled scripts the skill is instructed to run and trust**, never as model judgment. The logic check report is always produced by the engine, never narrated by the model.

### AC4 — stale-edit guard (two levels)

factlog enforces freshness through two distinct mechanisms:

| Level | Mechanism | What it guarantees |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Hook-enforced** | `PreToolUse` hook denies any `Write`/`Edit` to `facts/accepted.dl` or `facts/query.dl` when `facts/logic_report.txt` is missing or older than those files (run `/factlog check` → `run_logic_check.py` to refresh) | The engine's compiled inputs cannot be overwritten when the logic report is stale — the hook blocks the tool call before the file is touched |
| **SKILL discipline (best-effort)** | `SKILL.md` instructs Claude to run `run_logic_check.py` and show `facts/logic_report.txt` verbatim before stating any conclusion | The model is *guided* to surface the engine report; it cannot be *forced* (R10: "cannot fully guarantee") — human review of the raw report is the final verification step |

These two levels are complementary: the hook closes the deterministic gap; the SKILL discipline covers the narration layer where engineering enforcement is not possible.
