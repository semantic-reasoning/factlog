# factlog — Agent Bridge

**One rule:** you do not draw conclusions. You produce files and call the bundled
CLI. The CLI returns the verifiable report. Anything you produce is a *candidate*
until the engine and a human confirm it.

Bundled scripts live under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/`; criteria documents under
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/factlog/references/`. The deterministic gate is also
backed by a plugin hook (`hooks/hooks.json`).

## Deterministic gate (do not skip)

1. Treat every fact/query you generate as `candidate`/draft — never promote it to
   engine input yourself.
2. Always run `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/run_logic_check.py` and show the
   resulting `facts/logic_report.txt` **verbatim** before stating any conclusion.
3. If the report shows `errors > 0`, return to the human instead of concluding.
   Surface `Policy Findings`, `warnings`, and `review_required` under a separate
   "needs review" section.
4. Only edit `facts/query.dl` during self-correction when the repaired query passes
   schema and engine re-validation; otherwise keep the original and log the attempt
   to `decisions/correction_trace.md`.

## Canonical source value for fact extraction

When writing extracted fact rows to `$FACTLOG_ROOT/runs/*.json`, the `source`
field MUST be a path relative to the KB root, prefixed with `sources/`.

Examples:
- `"sources/my-doc.md"`
- `"sources/subdir/notes.md#section-heading"`

Bare filenames (e.g. `"my-doc.md"`) are NOT valid and will be silently dropped
by `merge_candidates.py`.  Always include the `sources/` prefix.

## Commands (to be implemented)

- `/factlog sync` — read `sources/`, extract candidate facts, update `pages/` and `decisions/`.
- `/factlog check` — compile accepted facts, run the logic check, show the report.
- `/factlog repair` — gated self-correction of `review_required` queries.
