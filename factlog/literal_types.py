"""Deterministic normalizers for typed literal values.

A relation declared in ``policy/typed-relations.md`` carries a literal object
(a date, number, or ordinal). To let the deterministic engine order/compare such
values, each raw object string is parsed here into a **canonical sortable
scalar**. This module is **pure**: no engine, no I/O, no ``pyrewire`` import.

Contract for every parser:
- returns the canonical scalar, or ``None`` if the string does not parse as that
  type (the caller emits a warning and loads the fact untyped);
- never raises on bad input, and never guesses.

``amount`` (e.g. ``100억``, ``1,000원``) carries a **unit**, so it normalizes to a
declared **integer base unit** via a reviewable unit table (Korean monetary units
only in this first cut: ``원/천/만/억/조``). Amounts compare in integer base units;
a sub-base-unit fraction is rounded to the nearest int (ROUND_HALF_UP). The engine
has no float column, so the base-unit value MUST be an exact integer — see
``parse_amount``.
