"""Deterministic normalizers for typed literal values.

A relation declared in ``policy/typed-relations.md`` carries a literal object
(a date, number, or ordinal). To let the deterministic engine order/compare such
values, each raw object string is parsed here into a **canonical sortable
scalar**. This module is **pure**: no engine, no I/O, no ``pyrewire`` import.

Contract for every parser:
- returns the canonical scalar, or ``None`` if the string does not parse as that
  type (the caller emits a warning and loads the fact untyped);
- never raises on bad input, and never guesses.

``amount`` (e.g. ``100억``, ``1,000원``) carries a **unit**, so it normalizes to a
declared **integer base unit** via a reviewable unit table (Korean monetary units
only in this first cut: ``원/천/만/억/조``). Amounts compare in integer base units;
a sub-base-unit fraction is rounded to the nearest int (ROUND_HALF_UP). The engine
has no float column, so the base-unit value MUST be an exact integer — see
``parse_amount``.

**Digits are ASCII-only.** Python's ``\\d`` matches the whole Unicode ``Nd``
category, so a full-width ``１００억`` used to parse to the *same scalar* as
``100억`` while ``relation/3`` kept the differing object string — one value with
three different answers to "is this the same?" depending on the code path. The
policy is **reject, not fold**: every numeric group below is spelled ``[0-9]``,
so a full-width value takes the ordinary "does not parse -> untyped" path and
surfaces as a typed-projection warning instead of merging silently. Rewriting the
stored string would have been the silent fold this repo consistently refuses.

This is not only about full-width U+FF10–FF19. ``\\d`` is exactly the Unicode
``Nd`` category, so Arabic-Indic ``١٠٠``, Devanagari ``१२३`` and Thai ``๑๒๓`` were
accepted the same way — and ``int``/``Decimal`` still accept all of them
(``int('١٠٠') == 100``), which is why the regex has to be the gate.

Several downstream paths change behaviour as a consequence. The conflict path
has one implementation in ``factlog.conflicts`` and three reporting surfaces;
none of these paths rewrites data already stored:

- ``tools/merge_candidates.py`` dedup key — ``canonical_amount`` returns ``None``
  for a full-width term, so ``amount(１００,억)`` and ``amount(１００,"억")`` stay
  two rows instead of collapsing into one. Collapsing them is exactly the fold
  this policy rejects. A newly merged full-width row also keeps its **source
  string verbatim** instead of being rewritten to the quoted canonical form;
  rows already in the KB are untouched either way.
- ``factlog.conflicts._group_key`` — a full-width object no longer
  normalizes to a scalar, so it keys as ``("raw", obj)`` while its ASCII twin
  keys as ``("scalar", …)``. Under a single-valued relation those are **two
  values**. When their policies load successfully, ``tools/check_conflicts.py``
  therefore exits **1**, ``factlog status`` reports the same conflict count, and
  the competing-values section of ``tools/corroboration.py`` reports source
  support for the same two groups.
  Scalar-equivalent typed spellings are likewise one value at all three
  surfaces. This is the one consequence that flips a green gate red — see the
  migration note in ``docs/reference/typed-relations.md``.
- ``common._canonical_value`` — a fact already stored as ``amount(１００,"억")``
  in an existing KB is no longer canonicalised, so a query written as
  ``amount(１００,억)`` misses it. Under this policy ``amount(１００,억)`` is not
  a valid amount term at all, so there is no canonical form to map it to. The ask
  router keeps that miss but emits a diagnostic when the accepted legacy spelling
  is a causally proven unit-quoting near-match. The fix is to correct the source
  to ASCII and re-collect, not to fold here.
- ``tools/ask_router.py`` answer annotation — ``humanize`` returns a full-width
  compound term verbatim rather than rendering it as ``１００억``, so the display
  suffix (``… (= 100억)``) is simply omitted for such a row.
A rejected value surfaces on an automatic warning, the shared conflict
grouping's reports, and one manual tool — and falls through one hole:

- **automatic** — under a relation declared **typed**,
  ``common._project_typed_relations`` warns on stderr and loads the fact untyped.
  The warning names the offending codepoints (``mark_non_ascii_digits``): its
  ``repr``-rendered value alone cannot tell ``1２3억`` from ``123억``, and the
  remedy it points at needs the reader to know which character is wrong.
- **conflict reports** — under a relation declared **single-valued**, the shared
  core sees the ASCII/full-width pair as two values. ``tools/check_conflicts.py``
  exits 1, while ``factlog status`` summarizes the count. Both name the offending
  codepoints only when ``digit_width_causes_parse_failure`` proves that changing
  a grammar-defined numeric token to ASCII makes the typed parser succeed; this
  diagnostic shadow never changes grouping. Corroboration's competing-values
  section shows distinct source support without adding correction guidance.
- **manual** — ``tools/entity_audit.py`` reports a value under a relation not
  declared an attribute as a *literal suspect*. Nothing in the pipeline runs it
  (``skills/factlog/SKILL.md`` documents it as a manual command) and its message
  says nothing about digit width. Its ``_LITERAL_RE`` is deliberately looser than
  this module and still matches full-width digits, so narrowing that detector
  would close this path (a pinning test guards the divergence). It only sees bare
  prose forms: ``１００억``/``２０２６``/``제３호``/``３위`` match, while ``３rd``
  and every compound term (``date(２０２０,１)``, ``amount(１００,"억")``,
  ``number(１２３)``, ``ordinal(３)``) do not — the same blind spots it has for the
  ASCII spellings, so this is not a regression.
- **hole** — a relation declared as an **attribute but not typed** has no spec, so
  the projection loop skips it without warning and its objects land in
  ``entity_audit``'s ``declared_literals``: an unflagged sorted list in which
  ``100억`` and ``１００억`` sort far apart.

    fraction is rounded to the nearest int (ROUND_HALF_UP) and documented as such.

    Prose fallback: a fused currency suffix (``100억원``) is recovered by stripping
    one trailing currency marker (``원``) and re-looking-up the stem (``억``) in
    *units*. This applies to the caller-supplied table too, and only succeeds when

    ``common.fold_relation_name``; this module stays pure, so it normalizes
    directly rather than importing ``common``). An object written in NFD — the
    macOS default for Hangul — is a different byte string from the composed unit

    untyped; two spellings of one value then split into a contradiction. Folding
    here also lets the ``억원`` currency fallback below see a composed ``원`` to

    For a **caller-supplied** table this narrows rather than widens: a *composed*
    table now matches NFD objects, and a hand-built *decomposed* table — which
    matched an NFD object by raw bytes before #325 — stops matching, because only
    the lookup side is folded and the caller's keys are left as given. Every
    in-repo caller passes either ``DEFAULT_AMOUNT_UNITS`` or the output of
    ``common._parse_amount_units``, both composed, so no caller changes
    behaviour; a new caller building a units dict by hand must compose its keys.

    The flat ``relation/3`` fact stores this object string verbatim; the engine
