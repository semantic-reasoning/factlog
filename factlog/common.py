    Plain ``min`` would be deterministic too, but it picks the wrong member in
    practice: Hangul conjoining jamo (U+1100…) sort below precomposed syllables
    (U+AC00…), so ``min`` on a mixed group *always* returns the decomposed form —
    the one that will not match if the reader types or pastes the name into a
    search from an NFC editor. Preferring NFC makes the reported string the one
    most likely to grep.

    The grep argument only holds where the group *has* a composed member. On a
    uniformly decomposed KB every candidate is NFD and this returns NFD — still
    deterministic and still a spelling actually written, which is the guarantee
    that matters.

    The fold is the same NFC as ``fold_relation_name``; the separate name is
    because this one is applied to subjects and values, not to policy relation
    names, and only the latter is a membership test.

    Every caller standing a representative in front of a folded group goes
    through THIS function, never through a re-derived ordering of its own:
    ``factlog.conflicts._representative`` for its scan and source-support
    projections, and ``kb_spellings`` for the spelling written into
    ``accepted.dl``. The checker and corroboration's competing-values clause
    consume those projections rather than deriving another ordering.

    Same function, but only the same ANSWER where the callers pool the same
    spellings, and they do not always. Two ways they can part:

    * *different partitions.* For a **canonically equivalent** conflict group the
      checker's pool and the compiled atom's agree. For a typed relation they do
      not: ``_group_key`` partitions on the parsed scalar, so it holds
      ``{NFD('제3호'), '3위'}`` as one value, while ``dedup_engine_atoms`` keeps
      two atoms because those strings are not canonically equivalent. Same
      representative rule applied to different partitions — the user-facing
      message is right about that, and this docstring should not be read past
      canonical equivalence.
    * *different scope.* ``kb_spellings`` pools a value over the WHOLE KB and
      over both the subject and the object axis, because ``accepted.dl`` is
      joined on and one entity must be one symbol there; the checker pools it
      over the rows of the conflict group it is reporting. Where a value is
      spelled consistently across positions — the shape the report was written
      for — the two land on the same string. Where it is composed only as an
      object and decomposed only as a subject they can differ, and the compiled
      file is the one that decides, because it is the one the engine reads.

    Each fails differently, and none of them fails usefully on its own:

    * ``canonical`` is EDB emitted by compile_facts into accepted.dl.  A head makes
      pyrewire treat it as IDB and silently drop every compile-emitted EDB atom —
      wrong answers with rc=0 (#227).
    * ``attr_rel`` is EDB emitted from policy/attribute-relations.md.  Same failure
      shape, and its consequence is that declared literals silently return to the
      entity graph: measured, one ``attr_rel(R) :- relation(S, R, O), R = "…".``
      line put engine path/2 back to ``[('갑봇','2030.1'), …]`` while the python
      renderer still answered ``[('갑봇','을서비스')]``, rc=0 — exactly the
      engine/renderer divergence #329 removed (#329 round 2).
    * ``entity_node`` is derived (``edge`` is gated on it).  A policy head ADDS
      rows to it and puts literals back in the graph; a ``.decl`` at another arity
      — ``pred(entity, reason)``, this repo's standard policy-predicate shape — made
      pyrewire raise a bare ``ExecError: execution error`` traceback, and with a
      matching fact present it died with SIGSEGV.

    They may appear freely in rule *bodies* (right of ``:-``) — that is the whole
    point of #227.

    Detection strategy: split the policy into logical STATEMENTS (a clause up to its
    terminating ``.``), stripping quoted strings first so ``"canonical("`` inside a
    reason literal is not mistaken for a predicate call, and cutting comments to the
    end of their line — an END-of-line comment left standing disabled this check
    outright (see the ordering note below).  Then tokenize each
    statement's HEAD — the predicate name left of ``:-``, or the whole clause for a
    bare fact — and reject it only when that name is exactly a reserved one.  Text
    that is not a clause at all (an unterminated statement, which absorbs the next
    one and would hide ITS head) is caught by a second pass that rejects a reserved
    name standing in call position anywhere a head can stand.  A
    substring search was wrong in BOTH directions and this replaces it: ``canonical
    (X, ...)`` with a space before the paren slipped past ``find("canonical(")`` (a
    head evaded the guard, rc=0), while ``not_canonical(X, ...)`` — a user predicate
    that merely CONTAINS the reserved name — was rejected as a head.

    The ``.decl``s in WIRELOG_PROGRAM are never passed as *policy_text*, but a
    hand-authored ``.decl canonical(...)`` in the policy re-declares the engine EDB
    and is still rejected (checked, then stripped, before statement splitting because
    a ``.decl`` directive carries no clause-terminating dot and would otherwise merge
    into — and mask — the head of the statement that follows it).

    A directive carries no clause-terminating '.', so it merges with the statement
    after it and would hide that statement's head. Stripping it is what stops
    `.output p2` above a bare `attr_rel("참조").` from riding in unexamined.

    OVER-consuming is its own bypass, and this has bitten twice. The strip stops
    at the parameters rather than at end of line, because
    `.output p2 attr_rel("참조").` on ONE line is a program pyrewire compiles and
    eating the remainder would delete a real reserved fact. It stops at the
    newline for the same reason.

    The third case is this function rather than the pattern: an operand that is
    ITSELF a terminated clause is not an operand. `.plan attr_rel("참조").` read
    `attr_rel` as the operand and `("참조")` as its parameters and deleted the
    whole fact — five characters, `.plan `, and the report's path answer flipped
    silently. pyrewire does the opposite: it takes the fact. So whenever the text
    that would be consumed is followed by `.` or `:-`, it is given back and only
    the keyword is removed. The neck counts because a rule head after a directive
    is a clause too, and `.plan attr_rel(R) :- …` is engine-accepted. That covers
    every directive, including any this engine does not implement today, without
    depending on which ones it does.

    A competing rule was available — never treat an atom followed by `(` as the
    operand — and the two disagree on exactly one shape::

        .limitsize attr_rel(n=10)
        p(X) :- relation(X,_,_).      here: PASS      paren rule: REJECT

    This one PASSES it: `attr_rel(n=10)` is followed by neither `.` nor `:-`, so
    it reads as the directive's own operand. pyrewire refuses that program either
    way (measured), so PASS cannot carry a wrong answer to a user and REJECT
    could not have saved one. The clause-terminator rule was chosen because it
    generalises to any directive taking a bare name, where the paren rule assumes
    operands are unparenthesised — an assumption `.limitsize p2(n=10)` already
    breaks, and refusing that shape is the false-rejection failure mode this
    guard has been sent back for twice.

    The adjacency is not always as authored: stripping a quoted literal makes it,
    ``O = "v1.0".canonical(`` becoming ``O = .canonical(``, so this cannot be
    handled by looking at the source text alone.

    This covers only dots MISREAD as directives. A GENUINE directive still merges

    (which aggregates sources under it), so the atom written to ``accepted.dl``
    and the source count reported for it cannot disagree.

    the relation does not.

    * *subject / object* — ``factlog.conflicts`` folds both (``_fold``,
      applied to subjects and to objects through ``_group_key``), and
      ``common._canonical_value`` (#213) fixed NFC as value equality for every
      query comparison. Keying the engine atom raw made the engine the one
      component that still saw two entities where the rest of the pipeline saw
      one: measured, a fact written once in NFC and once in NFD produced two

      ``accepted.dl`` — the inflated duplicate count ``dedup_engine_atoms``
      exists to prevent, arriving through the normal ``finalize`` path (#342).

      This fold is per-triple, which is NOT the checker's subject fold:
      ``_group_key`` folds the subject across rows into a bucket. Two rows with
      the same folded subject and different objects stay two atoms here and are
      one group there, so the checker remains stricter on that axis. See

    * *relation* — left verbatim for engine atom identity and corroboration's
      general fact/source list until #386. The conflict core already folds this
      axis for the checker, status, and competing-values clause while restoring
      an authored spelling for reports. Thus two spellings of one relation still
      make two ``relation/3`` atoms even though conflict analysis compares them
      together.

      Read that as "this function does not fold it", never as "the axis is
      unfolded". ``canonical_atoms`` NFC-folds the relation before its alias
      lookup, so the SAME ``accepted.dl`` can carry two ``relation/3`` atoms and
      one ``canonical/3`` atom for one aliased pair; and ``_canonical_value``
      folds a query's relation argument, so one spelling typed by the user
      already matches both. #386 tracks making engine identity and its provenance
      maps agree with those folded consumers.

    NFC only — never NFKC, never casefold. Fullwidth ``ＡＢＣ`` and ``ABC``, and
    ``a`` and ``A``, are different values and must stay different atoms.

    Every map keyed by this must be *looked up* through it too. ``fact_signals``
    and ``corroboration_counts`` build their keys here; ``ask``'s renderer folds
    the engine row it holds through :func:`fold_atom_triple` before asking them.
    Half a move — one side folded, the other raw — is wrong in two different
    ways depending on the group's shape: it under-counts where the raw lookup
    still happens to hit, and drops the annotation outright where the
    representative is synthesized. Neither merely duplicates, which is what the
    all-raw arrangement did. See ``fact_signals`` for both measured.

    :func:`kb_query_spellings` is NOT one of those maps and is not an exception
    to the rule: it is keyed on ``_canonical_value``, which folds further than
    this (``literal_types.canonical_amount`` on top of NFC), and it is looked up
    through that same function by :func:`resolve_query_spellings`. Named here
    because it is the third spelling-related map in this file and the obvious
    question at this paragraph is whether it belongs to the enumeration above."""

    """Map each value's NFC key to the ONE spelling ``accepted.dl`` writes for
    it, chosen by ``composed_spelling`` over every spelling of that value
    anywhere in *rows* — both the subject and the object axis, pooled.

    **Why the pool is the whole KB and not the atom's own group.** The spelling
    in ``accepted.dl`` is not a label; the engine joins on it. Choosing a
    representative inside one folded group rewrites that group and leaves an
    untouched neighbour alone, so a KB holding both forms ends up spelling one
    entity two ways and the collapsed atom stops joining the fact beside it.
    Measured on three confirmed rows — ``NFD(삼성) 대표 NFD(이재용)``,
    ``NFC(삼성) 대표 NFC(이재용)``, ``NFD(이재용) 거주 NFD(서울)`` — group-local
    choice folds the first two to NFC, leaves the third in NFD, and takes
    ``path/2`` from 4 to 2. Re-measured against the current tree, which answers
    every spelling of that path the same way::

        undeduped (what main writes)   path(NFD삼성, NFD서울)? -> ok / rows: 1
        group-local (rejected)         path(NFD삼성, NFD서울)? -> fact_absent
                                       path(NFC삼성, NFC서울)? -> fact_absent
                                       path(NFC삼성, NFD서울)? -> fact_absent
        KB-wide (shipped)              both single-form spellings -> ok

    So the rejected design turns a path main answers into a **verified negative
    for a path the KB supports**, and no spelling recovers it. That is the #342
    harm reappearing on the path axis, and identity and spelling must therefore
    be decided over the same scope.

    The diagnostic used to differ by spelling — one form drew a loud
    ``entity_not_accepted``, another a silent ``rows: 0``. It no longer does, and
    the reason is worth knowing before re-deriving this decision (#342):
    :func:`kb_query_spellings` now resolves query constants, and on the rejected
    file ``삼성`` and ``서울`` are each spelled one way, so both ENDPOINTS resolve
    and clear the membership gate. Only ``이재용`` is spelled two ways, and it is
    the middle node — refused by the map, but never a query argument. The gate
    therefore passes and the broken join surfaces as ``fact_absent``. Do not go
    looking for the refusal; the harm is now uniformly the silent one, which
    makes the argument stronger, not weaker.

    **Why the two axes share one pool.** ``entity_node`` admits a value from
    either position and ``edge(S, O) :- relation(S, R, O), entity_node(O)``
    chains an object into the next atom's subject, so one value's two positions
    must agree. Pooling per axis is not enough and the three rows above show it:
    ``이재용`` is composed only as an object and decomposed only as a subject, so
    an axis-local pool has no composed member to prefer on either side and the
    join stays broken.

    **Byte-invariance.** Every pool of a KB written one way is a singleton and
    ``composed_spelling`` of a singleton is that element, so an NFC-only KB and a
    uniformly decomposed KB both map every value to itself — verified
    byte-identical against origin/main. Nothing is normalized on the way out: a
    pool with no composed member yields the decomposed spelling, which is a
    spelling the KB actually wrote.

    A widened pool never picks a *less* composed spelling than a group-local one
    would. At most one member of a pool can itself be in NFC (two NFC strings
    equal under NFC are the same bytes), so where the group had a composed
    member the wider pool finds the same one, and where it had none the wider
    pool may find one — the fix direction only.

    **The lookup side is** :func:`kb_query_spellings`. This function decides what
    ``accepted.dl`` is WRITTEN as; that one reads back what it holds and moves a
    query's constants onto it, which is the "looked up through the same key" rule
    ``engine_atom_key`` states. The two are deliberately not one map — it is
    keyed on ``_canonical_value`` rather than plain NFC, takes accepted rows
    rather than candidates, and refuses any value the file spells more than one
    way; see its docstring for why each of those three has to differ.

    Not shared with ``factlog.conflicts._representative``, which pools a value over
    the rows of its own conflict group. For a value spelled consistently across
    positions the two agree, which is the case the report was written for; where
    a value is composed only in object position and decomposed only in subject
    position they can name it differently, and this one wins because it is the
    one the engine reads."""

def dedup_engine_atoms(rows: list[dict[str, str]]) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    """Collapse rows that are the same engine atom (``engine_atom_key``) to one
    row, emitted in first-occurrence order.

    The engine atom carries only the triple (see ``dl_atom``); the same fact
    accepted from several sources must appear once in ``accepted.dl`` so ``ask``
    and ``run_logic_check`` report set semantics (one row / true count) rather
    than an inflated, duplicated count. Source aggregation (``sources: N``,
    provenance) lives on the separate candidates path (``corroboration_counts``,
    ``fact_signals``) and is untouched by this collapse.

    **Which spelling is written.** Per VALUE, not per group: both axes are
    looked up in :func:`kb_spellings`, which pools every spelling of a value
    across every engine row and both positions before applying
    ``composed_spelling``. Choosing inside the group instead breaks the join to
    the rest of the KB — see that docstring for the measured shape and for why
    the pool cannot be per-axis either.

    The composed spelling is the one a reader greps for from an NFC editor, and
    the one the engine's typed projection can parse
    (``_project_typed_relations`` hands ``literal_types.normalize`` the object as
    written, so a decomposed ``NFD('7위')`` normalizes to ``None`` and the fact
    silently leaves the typed table). Preferring it only *rescues a value the KB
    spells that way somewhere*. Where every occurrence is decomposed there is
    nothing to prefer, the atom stays decomposed, and the typed literal is
    dropped exactly as before — see the byte-invariance note below, which is the
    same fact stated as a guarantee.

    Ranking whole rows instead — picking the group member that sorts first — is
    what an earlier revision did, and it is wrong on a *cross* group: one row
    NFD-subject/NFC-object and another NFC-subject/NFD-object have no member
    composed on both axes, so whichever row wins writes a decomposed axis while
    the KB demonstrably holds a composed spelling for it. The two axes are
    independent and are chosen independently.

    So the emitted row can be a triple no single input row carried. That is safe
    only because every map keyed on an atom is keyed on ``engine_atom_key`` and
    looked up through it (``fact_signals``, ``corroboration_counts``); a
    raw-triple map would miss the synthesized atom entirely and drop its
    provenance. The non-triple fields (source, confidence, status) come from the
    group's FIRST row, so first-occurrence still decides everything the fold does
    not.

    Observability consequence, unchanged in kind and wider in reach now that the
    pool is KB-wide: ``compile_facts`` prints ``source=`` from that first row
    beside a triple the row may never have written, and the spelling can come
    from a row in a different group entirely. The aggregate ``sources=N`` beside
    it is the honest count (it is keyed on the atom); the single ``source=`` is a
    sample, not the provenance of those exact bytes. Nothing downstream reads it
    — ``ask`` renders ``source_paths`` from ``fact_signals`` — so this is a log
    legibility matter, recorded rather than fixed.

    **Byte-invariance.** ``composed_spelling`` of a one-element set is that
    element, so a value the KB spells one way maps to itself and its row is
    yielded untouched — the same object, not a copy. A KB that spells every
    value one way — every NFC-only KB, and every uniformly-NFD one — therefore
    compiles to a byte-identical ``accepted.dl``, measured against origin/main.
    Nothing is normalized on the way out; a uniformly decomposed KB keeps its
    decomposed spelling, because no pool has a composed member to prefer.

    The bytes of an atom change only where the KB itself holds more than one
    spelling of a value, and then only to a spelling that KB already wrote. Note
    the scope: because the pool is KB-wide, an atom can be rewritten even when
    its own group is a singleton — a value written NFC in one fact and NFD in
    another is unified in both, which is the whole point. Only a KB already
    mixing forms for one value sees this.

    **Agreeing with itself is the correction only because the query side moves
    too.** Collapsing the atoms without that is half a move: it picks one
    spelling per value KB-wide, and a query typed in the other spelling then
    addresses nothing — measured on the three rows in :func:`kb_spellings`, where
    BOTH single-form ``path`` queries were refused and ``count`` answered ``0``
    while presenting it as verified. :func:`kb_query_spellings` and
    :func:`resolve_query_spellings` are the read side that closes it, applied by
    ``classify_query``, ``ask_router.evaluate`` and ``run_logic_check``. Anything
    that changes which spelling this function writes has to keep them in step;
    the write side alone decides only what the file contains, not what a reader
    can ask for."""

# atoms collapse to one spelling on disk and a query typed in the other spelling

# Which argument positions of a query atom hold a VALUE (a subject, an object, a

# absent from this table is a policy predicate, whose every position is a value

    """Map a query constant's ``_canonical_value`` key to the ONE spelling
    ``accepted.dl`` actually holds for it.

    **Pass ACCEPTED rows** (``load_accepted_facts()``), never candidates. The
    refusal below is per value over whatever rows it is given, and candidates
    still carry every spelling the sources used — the duplicates
    ``dedup_engine_atoms`` exists to collapse. Handing them in therefore refuses
    exactly the values a mixed KB most needs resolved, quietly turning the map
    off. ``value_set`` filters a row list carrying ``status`` down to engine
    input, so the mistake does not raise; it just returns a smaller map. Every
    caller today reads ``load_accepted_facts()``.

    Read-side observation of what the file HAS, deliberately not a wrapper around
    :func:`kb_spellings`. Three reasons they cannot be the same map:

    * ``kb_spellings`` is keyed on plain NFC; a query constant is folded by
      ``_canonical_value``, which folds NFC **and** ``amount`` unit quoting. A
      query keyed one way cannot look up a map keyed the other.
    * ``kb_spellings`` takes CANDIDATE rows (it reads ``status`` through
      ``engine_input_rows``) and answers "what should be written". This answers
      "what was written", which is the only thing a query can address. A KB
      compiled by an older factlog, or an ``accepted.dl`` edited by hand, is
      described correctly by this map and incorrectly by the other.
    * the value pool is ``value_set`` — subjects and objects only, never relation
      names. Relation names must stay out while engine identity leaves that axis
      unfolded (#386), or a value that is also a relation name would otherwise
      take part in a fold it has no representative for.

    **A value spelled more than one way is refused, not guessed.** The refusal
    is on the RAW spellings: a key is kept only when the whole KB writes that
    value exactly one way. Anything looser resolves a query onto an atom the user
    did not name, in two different ways:

    * *past NFC.* ``_canonical_value`` folds further than NFC —
      ``literal_types.canonical_amount`` makes ``amount(1,000,"억")`` and
      ``amount(1000,"억")`` one key — while ``merge_candidates`` canonicalises
      only the object, never the subject. One ``accepted.dl`` can hold two
      distinct atoms sharing a key.
    * *within NFC.* ``relation/3`` atoms are keyed on BYTES, so two canonically
      equivalent subjects are two atoms, not one. Refusing only on a second NFC
      form would let a stale or hand-edited file answer the decomposed atom's
      question from the composed atom's row — measured on
      ``relation(NFD(삼성), "대표", "이건희")`` beside
      ``relation(NFC(삼성), "대표", "이재용")``, where
      ``relation(NFD(삼성), "대표", O)?`` went from ``O=이건희`` to ``O=이재용``.
      Substituting one atom's facts for another's is worse than the
      unaddressability it was meant to cure.

    A refused key is simply absent, and a query naming it passes through
    untouched to fail (or succeed) exactly as it does without this map. The cost
    is nothing on a compiled KB: ``kb_spellings`` already gives each value one
    spelling in ``accepted.dl``, so every pool of a freshly compiled KB — mixed,
    uniformly composed or uniformly decomposed — is a singleton. Only a file that
    was hand-edited or written by an older factlog loses resolution, and there it
    keeps its pre-existing behaviour rather than acquiring a new wrong answer.

    The representative goes through :func:`composed_spelling`, the same rule
    ``kb_spellings`` uses to choose what to WRITE, so "which spelling wins" has
    one definition on both sides. Under the refusal above every surviving pool is
    a singleton and the call is an identity; it is kept so that a future decision
    to admit wider pools inherits the shared rule instead of re-deriving an
    ordering of its own."""

def resolve_query_spellings(line: str, spelling: dict[str, str]) -> str:
    """Rewrite *line*'s value constants to the spellings ``accepted.dl`` holds.

    *spelling* is :func:`kb_query_spellings`. Substitution happens on the query
    STRING, before it is parsed or handed to the engine, because the engine joins
    on bytes: resolving only a gate's membership test leaves the engine with the
    original constant and turns a loud ``entity_not_accepted`` into a silent
    ``rows: 0`` verified negative, which is worse than the refusal it replaces.

    Only quoted constants at a VALUE position move (see
    ``_QUERY_VALUE_POSITIONS``); variables, bare tokens, the relation argument
    and ``review_required``'s question string are left alone.

    A predicate this module does not know is a policy predicate, and EVERY
    position of one is resolved. Resolving only position 0 would leave a folded
    KB's hand-written policy queries unable to name their own values at the
    positions past it; both the report and the router call THIS function, so
    that choice would not make them disagree with each other — it would make
    both wrong together.

    Positions past the first hold reason codes, and resolving them is safe only
    *conventionally*, not necessarily. ``generate_logic_policy.REASON_RE`` forces
    ``[a-z0-9_]+`` on every GENERATED code, and no such code can collide with a
    Korean KB value or differ from it by normalization, so the map never touches
    one. A hand-written ``logic-policy.extra.dl`` is not bound by that regex: a
    non-ASCII constant at position 1 that also names a KB value stored in the
    other normal form WILL be rewritten, onto a spelling the engine's row does
    not carry. That used to end the match, because ``policy_row_matches``
    compared raw at every position — ``needs_review(NFC(삼성), NFC(보류))?``
    against a KB storing ``NFD(보류)`` reported ``0 rows`` under an extent line
    that had just said ``1 rows`` (#383). The rewrite still happens; what changed
    is that ``policy_row_matches`` now folds past the first position, so the
    rewrite cannot cost the match. Position 0 is still compared raw there, for
    the reasons that function documents. See
    ``tests/unit/test_query_spelling_resolution.py`` for the rewrite and
    ``tests/unit/test_policy_query_filter.py`` for the match.

    **Returns *line* UNCHANGED when nothing was substituted** — identity, not
    merely an equivalent line. Reassembly normalises whitespace
    (``relation( "a" , "b" , O )?`` comes back as ``relation("a", "b", O)?``), so
    rewriting unconditionally would silently reformat every query line of a
    uniformly spelled KB, where this function has nothing to do. Total: an
    unparseable line is returned as given."""

    """Validate a single candidate Datalog query line against the current KB state.

    Returns (True, "passed") on success or (False, reason) on failure — a thin
    back-compatible wrapper over ``classify_query`` (which also returns a stable
    ``code``). This is the deterministic re-validation anchor used by the
    self-correction loop (AC4): after each LLM repair attempt the corrected query
    is run through this function before being accepted.

    ``policy_program`` lets callers supply the policy program text directly. When
    None (default) the compiled ``policy/logic-policy.dl`` is loaded, which
    requires that file to exist. Callers that must tolerate a KB without a
    compiled policy (e.g. interactive ask before ``/factlog check``) can pass the
    file's text if present or ``""`` if absent, so a missing policy yields an
    empty policy-predicate set instead of a hard exit.
