"""factlog command-line helper.

The skill itself is installed as a Claude Code **plugin** (see README), so this
CLI does not install the skill. It provides environment and knowledge-base
helpers for the deterministic engine:

- `doctor`  — verify Python and pyrewire meet factlog's requirements.
- `init`    — scaffold an empty knowledge base layout (stub; see plan).
- `setup`   — one-shot bootstrap: doctor, ensure deps, init KB, re-check.
- `ingest`  — convert a binary/office file (docx, pdf, ...) into a text source
              under sources/ so fact extraction can read it.

def cmd_eject(args: argparse.Namespace) -> int:
    """Inverse of `ingest`: remove a source — or a single fact — from the KB.

    Two mutually exclusive modes:

    Source mode (`eject <source>...`) — for each named source:
      - deletes its runs/sources/ conversion (the ingest output);
      - strips the source's extracted rows from every runs/*.json (removing a
        now-empty run file) so a later merge stays consistent;
      - retires the source's rows in facts/candidates.csv — marked `superseded`
        by default (kept for audit), or removed entirely with --purge;
      - optionally deletes the user's original under sources/ with
        --delete-original (off by default: ingest never created it).
    A source is named by its filename, stem, or KB-relative path. Naming the
    binary original (e.g. report.pptx) also matches its runs/sources/<stem>
    conversion; a bare stem matches every source with that stem. eject also
    catches a source cited only in candidates.csv (an already-orphaned ref).

    Orphan mode (`eject --orphans`) selects every orphaned source automatically
    instead of naming each one: a runs/sources/ conversion whose ingest original
    under sources/ is gone (read from the provenance header), or a cited source
    whose file no longer exists on disk. This reconciles deletions made directly
    in sources/ in one pass. A hand-placed runs/sources/ file (no provenance
    header) has no original to track and is never treated as an orphan. Honours
    --purge / --delete-original / --dry-run like an explicit source list.
    Detection pairs a conversion in a subdir (runs/sources/a/report.md, which
    ingest mirrors from sources/a/report.*) with its original by subdir-aware rel
    key, so same-name originals in different subtrees no longer mask each other; a
    flat conversion (runs/sources/report.md) keeps the legacy basename match since
    its path records no subdir. Either way it errs toward keeping. Renaming an
    original on disk without re-ingesting counts as orphaning its old conversion.

    Fact mode (`eject --fact SUBJECT RELATION OBJECT`, repeatable) — retires
    candidate rows matching the given (subject, relation, object) triple(s)
    across all sources, leaving the source files in place. The default
    `superseded` keeps runs/*.json untouched so the retirement survives a later
    sync (merge_candidates preserves it); --purge deletes the rows and strips
    runs/*.json. --delete-original is rejected in fact mode.

    Both modes recompile facts/accepted.dl so the engine input drops the retired
    facts. With --dry-run nothing changes; the planned actions are printed.
