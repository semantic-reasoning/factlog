# Active KB (target the set-up KB from anywhere)

> 🌐 **English** | [한국어](active-kb.md)

`factlog use <kb>` — or the first `factlog init`/`setup` while no active KB is
set yet — records the chosen KB as the **active KB**, so `ingest`/`ask`/`sync`
and the tools target it from any working directory — no `--target`/`--wiki`
needed:

```bash
factlog use ~/wiki        # make ~/wiki the active KB (recorded in config)
factlog where             # show the active KB and how it was resolved
factlog sources           # list registered sources (original, conversion, fact count)
factlog status            # KB state: facts by status, vocabulary, conflicts, logic freshness, engine
cd /anywhere && factlog ingest report.pdf   # → ~/wiki/runs/sources/report.txt
factlog eject report.pdf  # inverse of ingest: remove the conversion + retire its facts
factlog ignore drafts/*.md   # exclude sources from sync (re-extraction)
factlog provenance Acme uses FastAPI   # trace a fact to its source(s)
```

Resolution precedence: `--target`/`--wiki` flag > `$FACTLOG_ROOT` > active-KB
config (`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/factlog/config.json`) > current directory.
With no config set, behavior is unchanged (uses the current directory).

## Resolution precedence table

The four candidates are walked from the top and the **first one with a value**
wins. Which one won is printed on `factlog where`'s `resolved from:` line.

| Rank | Source | How to set it | `resolved from:` in `factlog where` |
|------|--------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | command-line flag | `--target <path>` (`--wiki <path>` on some tools) | (not shown — see below) |
| 2 | environment variable | `export FACTLOG_ROOT=<path>` | `env ($FACTLOG_ROOT)` |
| 3 | active-KB config | `factlog use <path>` (or the first `init`/`setup`, while no active KB is set) | `config file` |
| 4 | current directory | (the fallback when nothing else is set) | `current directory` |

Rank 1 never appears in `factlog where`'s output because `where` itself does not
take `--target`. A flag applies only to the **single command** it was given to, so
`where` always reports a result resolved from ranks 2–4.

Whichever way a path arrives, it goes through `~` expansion and absolute-path
normalization. If the config file is missing, its JSON is corrupt, or its `root`
field is empty, resolution **falls through to the next rank instead of crashing** —
ultimately to the current directory.

## Creating a KB and choosing the active one are separate acts

`init`/`setup` **create** a KB; `use` **chooses** the active one. So there are
only four ways `init`/`setup` treat the active-KB setting:

| Situation | Active-KB config |
|-----------|------------------|
| No config file yet | records the KB just created (the first-run experience, unchanged) |
| The target is already recorded | unchanged (the file is not even rewritten) |
| Another KB is recorded | **left alone**. The new KB is not recorded, and the output says how to switch |
| The file cannot be read | **not touched**. See "A damaged config file" below |

```text
factlog init: created /tmp/scratch
factlog init: active-KB root unchanged: /Users/me/wiki — /tmp/scratch is not recorded in the config
  to record it in the config: factlog use /tmp/scratch   (or re-run with --activate)
```

The wording says active-KB **config**, not "active KB", for accuracy: this
decision is about the config file, while which KB is actually in force also
depends on `$FACTLOG_ROOT`. Two separate lines cover that.

When `$FACTLOG_ROOT` names something **other than what the config records** — i.e.
it genuinely overrides it — one line says so. The comparison is against the
**config**, not against the KB just created: if the environment and the config
agree, nothing is being overridden and no line appears.

```text
  note: $FACTLOG_ROOT=/tmp/envkb outranks the config in this session (factlog where)
```

And when a flagless command would **not reach** the KB just created, another line
says where it would go instead and where that came from. This one follows the
same resolution `factlog where` reports (`$FACTLOG_ROOT` > config > cwd), not the
config alone.

```text
  a flagless command would target /Users/me/wiki (from $FACTLOG_ROOT), not /tmp/scratch — pass --target /tmp/scratch, or point $FACTLOG_ROOT at /tmp/scratch
```

`setup`'s closing line asks the same question, because "where does my next
`/factlog sync` go" is what the user is actually asking — not what the config
happens to record.

The point is that creating one throwaway KB must not cost you the KB you were
working in. Pass `--activate` to create and switch in one step, or
`--no-activate` to leave the setting untouched even when none is set yet (scripts,
scratch KBs). Passing both is a usage error (exit code 2).

If you relied on `init`/`setup` moving the active KB for you, add `--activate` or
follow with `factlog use <path>`. The changed behaviour is printed where it
happens, so it never changes silently.

The target of a bare `init`/`setup` changed too. It used to be `~/wiki` always;
now `$FACTLOG_ROOT` and the active-KB config come first. A script that ran a
flagless `init`/`setup` in an environment where either is set now targets that,
not `~/wiki`. Pass `--target ~/wiki` for the old destination. Either way, the
chosen target and where it came from are printed on the first line of every run.

A configured active KB whose path does not currently exist (an unmounted volume,
say) is still your choice: `init` will not take the setting over. Moving it is
always something you do on purpose.

### A damaged config file

If the config file **exists but cannot be read** — truncated JSON, not an object,
no permission — `init`/`setup` do not write to it. The bytes they cannot read may
*be* the user's KB root, and a write would replace both that root and any `lang`
with nothing: a strictly worse loss than a root pointing at an unmounted volume,
which at least survives as text.

```text
factlog init: active-KB config at /Users/me/.config/factlog/config.json could not be read — leaving its bytes untouched; /tmp/scratch is not recorded in it
  repair that file, or overwrite it deliberately: factlog use /tmp/scratch
```

`factlog lang <code>` also refuses to write this damaged regular file. Setting
the language is the whole command, so a refusal **exits 1**. It leaves the bytes
in place and names both the risk and the deliberate escape hatch.

```text
factlog lang: narration language NOT set: /Users/me/.config/factlog/config.json could not be read — leaving its bytes untouched, because writing it would destroy the KB root it may still hold. Repair that file, or overwrite it deliberately: factlog lang ko --force
```

Use `--force` only after deciding to discard this truncated regular file rather
than repair it. This is an explicit replacement, not recovery: a successful run
exits 0 and records only the language, while potentially recoverable KB-root
bytes in the old file are lost. The replacement config records no root, so until
one is recorded, flagless commands target the fallback named in the output. To
record an active KB root again, run `factlog use <kb>`.

```text
factlog lang: narration language set to ko
  replaced an unreadable config (any KB root it may still have held is gone)
  the config now records no KB root — a flagless command would target /Users/me/wiki (from the current directory); record one with: factlog use <kb>
  config: /Users/me/.config/factlog/config.json
```

`setup --lang` is withheld for the same reason: recording a language rebuilds the
whole config file, so it would erase the root bytes that could not be read — the
command would be touching the file one line after saying it left it alone. The
`--lang` you asked for was not applied, so `setup` **exits 1**. Exiting 0 would
hand a script three agreeing signals — the exit code, a completion line, and an
empty `factlog lang`.

A config file that is a **broken symlink** — typically a link into a dotfiles
volume you have not mounted — is classified as unreadable too, so the same
activation refusal and the same `--lang` deferral happen. What is at stake is a
**pointer** rather than bytes worth preserving, though, so the wording differs.
Writing at the link replaces it with a regular file, and remounting the volume no
longer brings the setting back; the remedy is therefore mounting it or re-pointing
the link, not repairing a file. The KB itself is still created; what is refused
is the write to the config file — both the activation and the `--lang`.

```text
factlog init: active-KB config at /Users/me/.config/factlog/config.json is a symlink whose target is not reachable right now — leaving the link in place; /tmp/scratch is not recorded in it
  mount it or re-point the link, or overwrite it deliberately: factlog use /tmp/scratch
```

When the final environment check passes, the line that `setup --lang` closes with
over such a config uses those same words, too.

```text
factlog setup: the KB at /tmp/scratch is ready, but --lang was not applied because /Users/me/.config/factlog/config.json is a symlink whose target is not reachable right now (see above). Mount it or re-point the link, then set the language with `factlog lang`; or record this KB and the language together: factlog use /tmp/scratch --lang ko.
```

If that check fails, this line is replaced by the one reporting the environment
problem, and the only remaining record that `--lang` was declined is the
`→ narration language NOT set: …` note in the summary. The exit code is 1 either
way.

Once you have repaired it — or decided it is expendable — `--activate` overwrites
it and reports what it replaced (the config is sound again at that point, so a
`--lang` in the same run applies normally). A file that **does** parse but records no usable
root (`{"lang": "ko"}`, `{"root": ""}`) is not damaged: there is no path in it to
lose, so it is recorded exactly like a first run, and `lang` is preserved.

With `--target` omitted, `init`/`setup` pick their target in the same order every
other command uses: `$FACTLOG_ROOT` > active-KB config > `~/wiki`. The current
directory is deliberately not in that chain — an `init` run from anywhere
scattering a KB layout into that spot would be the worse default. A target you
did not spell out is printed with where it came from.

Leaving it out of the chain is not enough on its own. `factlog where --porcelain`
prints the current directory when nothing is configured, and the skill exports
that value as `$FACTLOG_ROOT` — so cwd can come back in through rank 2. When the
target was **not** named on the command line, resolves to the current directory,
that directory already holds something, and it is not already a factlog KB,
`init` stops instead of creating anything. Name it with `--target <path>` if that
really is what you want. An empty directory and an existing KB have nothing to
lose, so both proceed.

```text
factlog init: no --target given; using /Users/me/wiki (from the active-KB config)
```

A target that is an existing **regular file** stops `init`/`setup` as well (exit
code 1). It used to raise a `NotADirectoryError` traceback on the way to creating
`<target>/sources`.

```text
factlog init: refusing to scaffold a KB at /Users/me/notes.md, which is an existing file, not a directory. Pass --target with a directory path.
```

Both commands share the step that picks the target, so `setup` says the same
sentence under its own name.

```text
factlog setup: refusing to scaffold a KB at /Users/me/notes.md, which is an existing file, not a directory. Pass --target with a directory path.
```

The check applies whether the target was named with the flag or came implicitly
from `$FACTLOG_ROOT`, the active-KB config, or `~/wiki`. A target you did not
name on the command line is reported **with the rank it came from** — the
traceback used to fire before the "no --target given" line, leaving no way to
tell whether the environment variable or the config file had chosen that path.

```text
factlog init: refusing to scaffold a KB at /Users/me/notes.md, which is an existing file, not a directory. It was chosen implicitly (from the active-KB config), not named on the command line — point that at a directory, or pass --target with a directory path.
```

## Checking which KB won

*Type in Claude Code:*

```bash
factlog where
```

```text
active KB: /Users/me/wiki
resolved from: config file (precedence: --flag > $FACTLOG_ROOT > config > cwd)
config file: /Users/me/.config/factlog/config.json
```

If you have set a narration language with `factlog lang`, a `narration language:`
line is printed as well (it applies to the assistant's prose only and has no
effect on engine output).

For scripting, `--porcelain` prints **only the active KB's absolute path, on one
line** — no label, no other lines.

*Run in the terminal:*

```bash
export FACTLOG_ROOT="$(factlog where --porcelain)"
```

A KB-targeting command like `ingest`, when run without a flag, tells you on its
first line which KB it picked and where that came from, so you can notice a write
to an unintended KB.

```text
factlog ingest: target KB /Users/me/wiki (from config)
```
