# Typed relations (`policy/typed-relations.md`)

> 🌐 **English** | [한국어](typed-relations.md)

Some relations carry a literal object that should be **compared**, not just
matched — so the deterministic engine can order it, threshold it, or range over
it (e.g. "launched after 2030", "rank <= 3"). Declare such relations in
`policy/typed-relations.md`. Because the object is a literal, the relation should
ALSO be declared in `policy/attribute-relations.md`.

One declaration per line:

```
- `relation name` : <type> as <ascii_alias>
```

`<ascii_alias>` names the engine side-relation that holds the comparable value.
It is an author-chosen ASCII identifier (`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`) so it stays a
legal engine name even when the relation name is non-ASCII. Quote a relation name
containing spaces in backticks.

The four types:

- `date` — `2030.1` / `2030-01-15` → sortable yyyymmdd. **Engine-projectable**
  (ordering / threshold / range).
- `ordinal` — `rank 3` / `3rd` → int rank. **Engine-projectable**.
- `amount` — `100억` / `1,000원` → integer base unit. **Engine-projectable**.
  Needs a unit table; supply one inline at the end of the line:
  `: amount as <alias> (억=1e8, 만=1e4, 원=1)` (values must be positive ints).
  Omit the clause to use the built-in default unit table.
- `number` — `1,000` / `3.5` → numeric magnitude. **Engine-projectable**: scaled
  ×1000 (3 decimal places) to a sortable int64. ⚠️ Thresholds in comparison
  predicates MUST be written in **scaled units**: `version >= 2.0` →
  `version_num(S, V), V >= 2000`. Precision beyond 3 decimals rounds
  (ROUND_HALF_UP).

Extractors may emit typed literal objects as compact compound terms when that
preserves structure better: `date(2030)`, `date(2030,1)`, `date(2030,1,15)`,
`number(2.5)`, `ordinal(3)`, `amount(100,"억")`. The `relation/3` object stores
that term as a string, and the typed side-relation projects the comparable
scalar.

A date compound term takes year, month or day precision. Missing parts default
to `01`, so `date(2030)` sorts as `20300101`, the start of the year — the same
convention that already fills in a missing day (`2030.1` → `20300101`). A
threshold like `D >= 20300101` therefore includes a year-only fact. The
human-readable form appended to an answer, by contrast, carries only the
precision the term actually has: `date(2030)` shows as `2030`, never padded out
to `2030-01`. A bare `2030` with no `date(…)` wrapper still does NOT parse as a
date — with neither a separator nor the wrapper it is indistinguishable from a
plain number.

Digits must be **ASCII**. A value carrying full-width digits — `１００억`,
`date(２０２０,１)`, the half-and-half `1２3억` — does NOT parse as any of
date/number/ordinal/amount. It takes the ordinary "does not parse → load
untyped" path and surfaces as a `typed-relations: … does not parse as …`
warning. Full-width is not folded to ASCII silently, because folding would
rewrite the stored fact string — the fix is to correct the source to ASCII and
re-collect. Under a relation that is not declared typed the parsers never run at
all, so there the two spellings simply stay separate values.

This is not only about full-width (U+FF10–FF19). Every digit in the Unicode `Nd`
category is rejected for the same reason — Arabic-Indic `١٠٠`, Devanagari `१२३`,
Thai `๑๒๓` — precisely the strings `int()` and `Decimal()` accept silently as
100 / 123.

The rule is about **fact values**, not about the declaration file. A `units`
clause still goes through `Decimal`, so `units(억=１００００００００)` is accepted
as `100000000` and a unit NAME is not checked for digits at all. The value is
computed correctly either way; write declarations in ASCII regardless, so the
file reads the way the values it governs have to be written.

⚠️ **Migrating an existing KB.** If full-width values collected before this rule
are still in the KB, `tools/check_conflicts.py` may now exit **1** — a gate
failure, not a warning. `１００억` and `100억` used to fold onto the same scalar
and count as one value; the full-width one now keys on its raw string, so for the
same subject a single-valued relation sees two values.

It does not stop at the gate. On a conflict `finalize` not only skips compiling
facts to `facts/accepted.dl`, it also **removes** an existing `facts/accepted.dl`
from disk, so a stale contradictory engine input cannot keep answering after a
failed compile. What you actually experience is therefore not "the gate went red"
but **`/factlog ask` no longer producing a verified answer until the conflict is
resolved**. With no engine input left to read, the question falls to the
wiki-exploration route, which still returns its `UNVERIFIED — wiki exploration`
block — and those excerpts may quote both sides of the unresolved conflict, so
they must not be read as a settled answer.

If an existing KB holds a full-width amount compound term
(`amount(１００,"억")`), a query written without the quotes —
`amount(１００,억)` — still misses, because a full-width term is no longer a valid
amount and so no longer folds to the same canonical form as the stored value.
However, `ask_router` now warns on stderr for `validate`, `render`, and a zero-row
`evaluate` when it finds a stored legacy unit-quoting near-spelling with the exact
same authored digit codepoints. Stdout JSON, routing, row count, and exit status
are unchanged, and no NFKC/compatibility fold or retry occurs. Different numbers,
numeral scripts, units, and ordinary identifiers containing digits do not trigger
this warning.

Both cases clear the same way: **correct the source to ASCII digits and
re-collect**. The `status='superseded'` advice the conflict message prints does
clear the gate, but superseding the ASCII row rather than the full-width one
leaves the KB holding a value that does not parse; where the two spellings denote
the same value neither row is "outdated", so supersede is the wrong tool to begin
with. `check_conflicts` and `factlog status` add the same correction guidance
only when the original fails to parse and a diagnostic shadow made by changing
**numeric-token digits only** to ASCII succeeds. Thus `제１분기` is not blamed:
`제1분기` is still not a date, and digits inside an `amount` unit name belong to
an opaque identifier and are never shadowed. This counterfactual explains the
cause; it does not fold or repair stored data, conflict groups, or engine input.

When policy files load successfully, `tools/check_conflicts.py`, `factlog
status`, and the **competing-values section** of `tools/corroboration.py` all use
the same authoritative grouping from `factlog.conflicts`. Declared aliases fold
to the canonical relation name, typed objects group on their parsed scalar, and
subjects, relations, plus untyped objects group under NFC equivalence. Thus
`amount(5400,"억")` and `amount(0.54,"조")` are one value at all three surfaces,
while an ASCII/full-width pair is two values because the full-width side does
not parse. Relation grouping treats NFC-equivalent spellings as one identity
while restoring a spelling actually authored for report provenance. General
engine `relation/3` atom identity uses the same NFC relation identity. Semantic
aliases remain separate raw atoms and meet in the optional `canonical/3` block.

The three surfaces still have different roles and detail. `check_conflicts` is
finalize's exit-1 gate and can disclose even resolved merges in detail; `status`
summarizes the conflict count and some correction guidance; corroboration is an
exit-0 report of distinct-source support per competing value. If a typed or alias
policy used by conflict analysis fails to load, status marks a degraded fallback;
if corroboration cannot load a relevant policy, it omits its competing-values
section. Do not read those cases as the same verdict. The engine's typed
side-relation projection still passes an authored NFD object unchanged to the
normalizer and commonly fails to parse it, while the conflict core first applies
NFC and may parse it successfully, so the results can still diverge.

Both spell the offending characters as `\uXXXX` (`\UXXXXXXXX` above the BMP), so
you can see which one to correct.

`factlog vocab` shows declared typed relations with a `[typed:<type>]` tag (e.g.
`[attribute, typed:date]`).
