# tests/test_finalize.sh — one-shot deterministic finalize chain (#29)
#
# After extraction writes runs/*.json, `finalize.py` chains merge -> ensure
# policy -> compile -> (logic check). This pins:
#   - candidates.csv and accepted.dl are produced (pyrewire-independent)
#   - policy/logic-policy.dl is ensured so the check can load (stub if no rules)
#   - with pyrewire>=1.0.3: logic_report.txt is produced; without it the check
#     is skipped gracefully (no hard failure) and facts are still compiled
#   - idempotent: re-running does not duplicate the fact
#
# Usage: bash tests/test_finalize.sh  -> 0 if all pass, 1 otherwise.
