# tests/test_entity_audit.sh — entity fragmentation / literal-leak audit (#51)
#
# Pins:
#   - no candidates.csv -> "no candidate facts", exit 0 (informational)
#   - entity list reports each entity with its fact count
#   - a substring-contained entity pair is surfaced as a fragmentation candidate
#   - an object that looks literal under an UNDECLARED relation is a literal
#     suspect, with a suggestion to declare it
#   - once that relation IS declared in attribute-relations.md, its object moves
#     to "declared literals", drops out of entities, and is no longer a suspect
#   - always exits 0
#
# Deterministic; no pyrewire.  Usage: bash tests/test_entity_audit.sh
