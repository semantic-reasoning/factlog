#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/test_eject_cmd.sh — `factlog eject`, the inverse of ingest
#
# Pins (XDG-isolated; synthetic data; no pyrewire needed — eject recompiles
# accepted.dl deterministically via compile_facts):
#   - naming a binary original (deck.pptx) also matches its runs/sources/<stem>
#     conversion; eject deletes the conversion, strips the runs/*.json rows
#     (removing the now-empty file), and supersedes the citing candidate row
#   - the original under sources/ is KEPT by default (with a note); accepted.dl
#     drops the retired fact but keeps the others
#   - --dry-run changes nothing
#   - --purge deletes the candidate row instead of superseding it
#   - --delete-original also removes the user's original under sources/
#   - a bare stem matches; an unknown name errors (rc != 0); non-KB path errors
#   - naming a *path* stays inside that path: `eject sub/report.html` never
#     reaches a same-name original in another directory (#324), while a bare
#     filename keeps matching every directory
