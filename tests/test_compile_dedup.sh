# tests/test_compile_dedup.sh — accepted.dl triple dedup across sources (#191)
#
# The same (subject, relation, object) accepted from several sources must become
# a SINGLE engine atom in facts/accepted.dl so ask/evaluate and run_logic_check
# report set semantics (one row / true count), not an inflated duplicated count.
# Source aggregation (sources: N, provenance) lives on the separate candidates
# path and must stay lossless.
#
# Pins:
#   (a) compile: a multi-source triple appears exactly once in accepted.dl
#   (b) ask evaluate: count=1, one row (no duplicate row)
#   (c) render: the single row still shows (sources: 2) — provenance lossless
#   (d) run_logic_check: `engine facts` count reflects the deduped set (no dup)
#   (e) byte-stability: a KB with no duplicate triple compiles unchanged
#   (f) Unicode: one fact written NFC and NFD is ONE atom, in the composed
#       spelling, and the engine sees one (#342)
#   (g) a uniformly decomposed KB keeps its decomposed spelling byte-for-byte
#   (j) a folded atom still joins the rest of the KB: one entity keeps one
#       spelling across accepted.dl, so path/2 and `ask` do not lose (or
#       verified-negative) a path the KB supports
#   (k) the folded KB stays ADDRESSABLE: `path` and `count` asked in ONE
#       normalization form — either one, which is what a human writes — reach
#       the facts. (j) is about the engine's internal join and is spelling-blind
#       by design; (k) is about the query constants a reader types, which is a
#       different claim and needs its own assertions
#
# Synthetic data only (relation path needs no pyrewire).

# fact beside it: measured, path/2 fell from 4 to 2 and `path(삼성, 서울)?` —
# a path the KB supports — answered `rows: 0 / verified negative`. The pool is
# therefore per VALUE over the whole KB and over both axes (common.kb_spellings).
# Note 이재용 is composed only as an OBJECT and decomposed only as a SUBJECT, so
# a per-axis pool has nothing to prefer on either side and leaves this red.
