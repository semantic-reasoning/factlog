# tests/test_typed_literals.sh — typed-comparison smoke harness (#121)
#
# Pins the CI-active value of typed literals without re-proving what pytest
# already covers (threshold/determinism/graceful-degrade live in
# tests/unit/test_typed_projection.py). Two layers:
#
#   1. compile layer (ALWAYS runs, NO pyrewire): the REAL compile_facts.py
#      filters candidates.csv by status, so a `superseded` typed row never
#      reaches accepted.dl (the engine input). Positive control: an `accepted`
#      row IS present. This is the section the CI `test` job actually exercises
#      (that job has no pyrewire).
#   2. sample-kb golden guard (NO pyrewire): examples/sample-kb must stay
#      untyped (no policy/typed-relations.md) so golden.sh stays byte-identical.
#   3. engine layer (pyrewire-GATED, skips cleanly): with the engine present,
#      run_logic_check.py surfaces `after2030: 을서비스 (launch_after_2030)` and
#      NOT the superseded 구서비스.
#
# Per-section gating (NOT a top-level exit 0): the compile assertions always run.
#
# Usage: bash tests/test_typed_literals.sh
#   With engine: PATH="/path/to/venv/bin:$PATH" bash tests/test_typed_literals.sh
