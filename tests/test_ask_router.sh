#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/test_ask_router.sh — deterministic /factlog ask routing core
#
# Proves the reason-class routing and relation evaluation of tools/ask_router.py:
#   - matching relation            -> route=engine, negative=false
#   - accepted vocab, fact absent  -> route=engine, negative=TRUE (verified
#                                     negative — NEVER wiki)
#   - unknown entity/predicate/no '?' -> route=wiki
#   - review_required predicate    -> route=wiki
#   - works with NO compiled policy (fresh KB), i.e. no hard exit
#   - evaluate returns matching rows / 0 rows
#   - render emits the greppable VERIFIED — engine marker (positive & negative)
#   - ask_router never writes facts/query.dl or mutates facts/accepted.dl
#
# Runs from the working tree via PYTHONPATH (no install / no pyrewire needed for
# the relation path).
#
# Usage: bash tests/test_ask_router.sh
#   Returns 0 if all checks pass, 1 if any fail.
