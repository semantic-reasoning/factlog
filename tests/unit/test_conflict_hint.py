"""The conditional guidance a conflict on a non-ASCII-digit value carries (#331).

``check_conflicts`` resolves conflicts by telling the user to mark the outdated
row ``status='superseded'``. Under a relation declared **typed**, that advice
assumes one of the two values is out of date. A value carrying non-ASCII digits
does not parse as the declared type at all, so it degrades to a raw-string key —
and following the generic advice on the *ASCII* row clears the gate while leaving
the KB holding the value the engine cannot read (measured: ``check_conflicts``
then reports ``0 conflicts`` and exits 0).

**The note is gated on the relation actually having a typed spec**, and that gate
is load-bearing rather than defensive. Under an UNTYPED single-valued relation
``_group_key`` returns a raw key because ``spec is None``, not because of digit
width: ``GPT-４`` and its ASCII twin ``GPT-5`` key identically, ``GPT-４`` is a
perfectly usable ``relation/3`` fact, and superseding the outdated row is exactly
the right fix. Every clause of the note would be false there, so it must not fire.

What these tests hold down is the *shape* of the note, not its prose:

* it fires only for a typed relation, and only when a value actually carries
  non-ASCII digits (the negative controls are what make that real — a note
  printed unconditionally would satisfy the positive cases alone);
* it names the offending characters as escapes, because ``repr('１００억')`` is
  ``'１００억'`` — visually identical to ``'100억'`` in most fonts;
* it does NOT claim supersession cannot resolve the conflict. Superseding the
  full-width row *does* resolve it. Nor does it claim re-collection *replaces*
  supersession: for genuinely different values (``100억`` vs ``２００억``)
  correcting the source leaves ``100억`` vs ``200억``, still a conflict that
  supersession must settle.

    Both touch ``parse_amount``, so the two policies have to be shown not to
    interfere. They cannot, for a reason worth stating once: the fold is **NFC**,
    and NFC does not change a single non-ASCII digit anywhere in Unicode. Of the
    750 non-ASCII ``Nd`` code points, 80 carry a decomposition mapping and none
    of those is canonical — every one is compatibility-tagged, which is what
    NFKC applies and NFC does not. The unit-name fold's position is *not* part of
    that argument: it runs at policy load, before any value reaches the ``[0-9]``
    numeric group, so it is upstream of the digit gate rather than downstream.

    **Five of the six tests here are CONTROLS**: they pass both with and without
    the #325 fold, verified by reverting both fold sites (still green). That is
    the point — the claim is "#325 changed nothing here", and a test that only
    passed after the fold would be evidence of the very interference this class
    denies.

    The exception is ``test_note_stays_silent_on_an_nfd_table_that_now_parses``,
    labelled at its own definition: it is a **conjunction pin**, green with both
    folds and with neither, red with either one alone. It belongs here anyway —
    what it holds down is that the two folds stay a matched pair, which is a
    precondition for the non-interference the rest of the class asserts. The pins
