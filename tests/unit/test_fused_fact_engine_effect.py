"""What a reserved bare FACT does to the engine once it reaches it (#358).

The guard is what keeps such a fact out of the program; these tests say why that
matters, by handing the engine the policy text the guard now refuses and reading
the answer back out of the REAL assembled program.

``attr_rel/1`` is pure EDB — the engine has no rules for it — so an in-program
bare fact is honoured and joins the atoms injected from
policy/attribute-relations.md. One line therefore reclassifies a relation as
"attribute", drops its object out of ``entity_node``, and removes the edge:
``path("갑봇","병문서")`` goes from a derived path to nothing, at rc=0.

That is not a general property of bare facts. A relation with rules (IDB) ignores
them, which is why probing this with an inert predicate reads as "no consequence"
when there is one. Both directions are pinned below so the distinction is not
re-derived from a single probe next time.
