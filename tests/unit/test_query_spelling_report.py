"""The logic report must answer a query written in either spelling, and echo back
the spelling the author wrote.

``relation_results``, the count branch and ``policy_row_matches`` all compare
RAW, so on a KB whose atoms were folded to one spelling per value the report
answered `0 rows` / `0 (distinct objects)` / `(not evaluated — not an accepted
entity: …)` to queries the KB does support. The report is the artifact SKILL.md
tells the reader to show verbatim before stating a conclusion, and its aggregate
is the line a reader is least able to check by eye.

The echo is the other half. The report is read beside ``facts/query.dl``; if it
printed back the spelling accepted.dl stores rather than the one the author
typed, the difference would be invisible on screen and unsearchable in the file.

    """``_paired_constants`` degrades rather than raising, and what it degrades TO
    is the whole point: the unresolved reading, so the fallback can only warn
    where the pre-resolution code warned.

    Nothing pinned it. Deleting the guard (``zip(..., strict=False)``) and
    inverting it (``[(c, c) for c in resolved]``) both left the suite green, so
    the next refactor could take either. It is a guard for a caller that does not
    exist yet, which is exactly the kind of branch that gets removed as dead — and
    the branch whose previous annotation caused the desync bug.
