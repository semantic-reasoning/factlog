"""The report and `ask` must give the same answer to the same path query (#329).

``run_logic_check`` validated every query constant against ``value_set``, which
includes literal values, so ``path("갑봇", "2030.1")?`` produced
``- path 갑봇 -> 2030.1: (not found)`` with **no warning at all**, while
``common.classify_query`` rejected the identical query as
``entity_not_accepted``. "(not found)" reads as "the facts were searched and do
not connect them"; the real reason is that a literal cannot be a path node.

The direction was already wrong before #329 (the report drew a POSITIVE path
through the literal), so this is not a new divergence — but the repo spent five
commits (287ec84…bf586b3) on exactly "the report and the router answer the same
query the same way", and the path axis was left out.
