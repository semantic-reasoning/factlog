"""Report / gate / router parity on a query's SIGNATURE — arity and shape (#328).

The gate (``classify_query``) applies two rules to every query: the argument
COUNT its predicate takes, then whether each argument is a Datalog variable or a
double-quoted string. Neither of the other two consumers applied both — count and
policy checked arity only, relation and path checked neither — so each answered
lines the gate rejects, and answered them WRONGLY, because each decides "is this
argument a constant" with its own predicate:

    count("Marie Curie", 'born_in')?
      report -> count over EVERY relation of the subject, printed as a verified
                aggregate (a non-double-quoted arg is a wildcard there)
      router -> count: 0, which reads as a verified negative (a non-variable arg
                is a constant there, and no fact has the relation "'born_in'")
      gate   -> (False, 'malformed', 'count arguments must be ...')

    relation("Marie Curie", "born_in", "Warsaw", X)?     # this triple IS a fact
      report -> relation results: 0 rows                 # reads as a denial
      router -> {'rows': [], 'count': 0}
      gate   -> (False, 'bad_arity', 'relation query must have ...')

The same mechanism ran through the rest: shape-malformed ``relation`` returned
rows spanning two relations with a ``'born_in'=worked_at`` binding, ``path``
returned the whole reachable set, a policy query returned the predicate's whole
extent bound to an entity it is not about (``Alice=Bob``), and an over-long
``path`` answered using the first two constants and ignoring the rest.

The fix is two shared rules — ``common.query_arity_error`` then
``common.query_shape_error`` — applied in that order by all three, so the classes
below assert the same verdict AND the same message on all three paths for the
same line. Testing only two of them is what let this survive: the count arity
guard (#257, 1bc172a) was pinned on the report AND the router precisely because
``cmd_evaluate`` calls ``evaluate`` with no ``classify`` in front of it, and a
test that imports only ``run_logic_check`` cannot see a router-only mutant.

NOT covered here, deliberately: the VOCABULARY axis, where the report and the
gate still legitimately disagree. ``count("Nobody", "born_in")?`` is well-shaped,
so the gate goes on to reject it (``entity_not_accepted``) while the report
answers ``0 (distinct objects)`` — a verified zero for a subject the KB has never
heard of. ``tests/test_count_check.sh`` pins that zero as intended behaviour, so
it is not changed here; ``validate_query`` now at least emits the same
"non-engine entity or relation" warning it emits for relation/path. Signature
parity is exact; vocabulary parity is not, and this file does not claim it.
