"""The active-KB reference pages must quote output the CLI can actually produce.

``docs/reference/active-kb.md`` and its English twin show ``text`` blocks of
``factlog init`` output, and both a user and an LLM read a reference page as a
contract. Three of those blocks in each page quoted wording the code had already
moved past — "active-KB config unchanged: … was created but is NOT recorded
there" when the tool says "active-KB root unchanged: … is not recorded in the
config", "leaving it untouched" for "could not be read — leaving its bytes
untouched", "(from the active KB config)" for "(from the active-KB config)". The
last of those had been corrected in the code by an earlier review and the new
page still carried the old spelling, which is the shape of the problem: the doc
was hand-written beside the code instead of taken from it.

So these run the command and compare. The only edit applied to the captured
output is path substitution — the pages use ``/Users/me/wiki``, ``/tmp/scratch``
and ``/Users/me/notes.md`` as illustrations, and a test cannot create those.
Every other byte, including the em dashes and the double space before ``(or
re-run with --activate)``, has to match what the page prints.

The blocks are excerpts: ``init`` also lists every scaffolded directory, and the
pages leave that out. Each scenario therefore names the prefixes it quotes, and
the assertion is that those lines, in that order, appear verbatim in both pages.

Two blocks are ``setup``'s, not ``init``'s, and they are driven through
``cli.main`` in-process with the doctor/pip stages stubbed — the same shape
``tests/unit/test_init_activation.py`` uses and for the same reason: a
subprocess ``setup`` would try to pip-install pyrewire when the engine is
absent, and its doctor output is machine- and locale-dependent noise.

The stub is not consequence-free for one of them, so state what it does: the
``--lang`` closing line is printed only under ``if final_ok and lang_deferred``,
so forcing the doctor to pass is what puts that branch in reach at all. With a
failing final doctor the run still exits 1, but that line is replaced by the
environment-problem one and the refusal survives only as the summary's
``narration language NOT set`` note — which is why the page states the premise.
What the stub does *not* do is compose the sentence or choose the exit code;
both come from unstubbed code, and those are what the page quotes. The
file-target block is a ``FactlogError`` raised before either stubbed stage is
reached.
