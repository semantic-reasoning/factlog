"""facts/logic_report.txt must record a run the engine could not complete (#338).

The tool used to write the report only after ``run_wirelog`` returned, so an
engine that could not start left the file untouched. Whatever report was already
there stayed on disk and read as this run's result — the report is not
timestamped in its own text, and neither ``/factlog check``'s output nor the
freshness gate could tell the two apart.

Every case here runs the REAL tool as a subprocess and asserts on the file it
leaves behind. That matters more than usual: the bug is about a file NOT being
written, and any test that builds the report by calling a helper directly would
be asserting about a code path the failing run never reaches.

Two failure causes are covered, because they fail through different exception
types and only one of them is a FactlogError:

- ``facts/accepted.dl`` absent -> ``FactlogError`` raised by ``run_wirelog``;
- the engine package unimportable -> also a ``FactlogError``, from
  ``require_pyrewire_version``, but reached without touching the KB at all. This
  is the "broken engine environment" the issue describes, and the case where no
  amount of fixing the KB helps.
