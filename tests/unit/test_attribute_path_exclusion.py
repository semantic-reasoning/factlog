"""policy/attribute-relations.md promises the object of an attribute relation is
kept OUT of the entity set "so they do not show up as entities, path nodes, or
count subjects".  The entity axis honoured it; **path did not** — a literal was a
node in the entity graph, both in the python renderer (`dependency_path`,
`ask_router._reachable_pairs`) and in the emitted engine program, whose `edge`
rule accepted every relation/3 unfiltered (#329).

The exclusion rule is ONE definition, not three: a value is a path node exactly
when it is in ``entity_set``.  A literal that is *also* a subject somewhere, or
the object of some non-attribute relation, IS an entity — so it stays a legal
path node.  Those two cases are pinned below because they are what separates
"mirror entity_set" from the cruder "drop every attribute edge", and the cruder
rule would put `classify_query` (which gates path endpoints on entity_set) and
`dependency_path` back into disagreement.

``TestEngineAndRendererAgree`` runs the REAL assembled program through
``common.run_wirelog`` and compares it to the python renderer on the same facts.
Do not delete it: it is the only thing that makes fixing one path and forgetting
the other fail loudly.
