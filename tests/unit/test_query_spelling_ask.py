"""``ask`` must answer a query written in either spelling of a mixed-spelling KB.

``dedup_engine_atoms`` collapses canonically equivalent atoms and picks ONE
spelling per value KB-wide, so an ``accepted.dl`` can end up addressable by no
single normalization form: in the KB below 삼성 and 이재용 land composed and
서울 stays decomposed. The reviewer's reproduction, kept here as rows so the
pins do not need a compiled KB on disk.

``count`` is the sharpest case and the reason ``evaluate`` is fixed on its own:
it answered ``0`` for a subject the KB has a fact about, and the router presents
that as a verified aggregate — the output a reader is least able to check by eye.

FACTLOG_ROOT is bound to a throwaway dir by the repo-root ``conftest.py`` before
any tool module is imported, so ``relation_aliases()`` in the count branch reads
that dir and not the developer's real knowledge base.
