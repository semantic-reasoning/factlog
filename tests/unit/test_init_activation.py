"""Creating a KB must not silently re-point the global active KB (#356).

``cmd_init``/``cmd_setup`` called ``factlog_config.write_root(target)``
unconditionally, so a single ``factlog init --target /tmp/scratch`` replaced
whichever KB the user had been working in — no confirmation, no record of the
old value, and nothing in the output that named it. Creating a KB and choosing
which KB is active are two different intents; only the second one owns the
global pointer.

The contract these pin: the pointer moves when nothing holds it yet (the
first-run experience ``setup`` exists for), when the target already *is* the
active KB (a no-op), or when the user asks with ``--activate``. Otherwise the
KB is created and the pointer is left alone, with the untouched value and the
command that would switch printed on stdout. ``--no-activate`` declines even
the first-run write.

Everything here drives the real entry point — ``python -m factlog`` in a
subprocess for ``init``, ``factlog.cli.main`` for ``setup`` (whose doctor/pip
stages are stubbed; the pointer decision itself is the un-stubbed code under
test). No test re-implements the decision it is checking.
