"""``kb_query_spellings`` / ``resolve_query_spellings`` — the READ side of the
spelling ``dedup_engine_atoms`` writes.

``kb_spellings`` picks one spelling per value for ``accepted.dl``. Its own
docstring says every map keyed that way must be *looked up* through it too, and
until these two helpers existed no lookup existed: a KB whose atoms had been
folded to one spelling could not be addressed by a query written in the other.
These tests pin the map's shape and the rewrite's invariants; the end-to-end
effect on ``ask`` and on the report is pinned where those paths live.
