"""`ask`'s provenance annotation must survive the engine-atom fold (#342).

`fact_signals` and the renderer's lookup are two halves of one key space. Before
the atom fold both halves were raw triples and every atom matched: a mixed-spelling
KB rendered two identical-looking rows — wrong, but nothing was MISSING; every
source path and staleness marker was on screen.

Folding the atom at compile time while leaving this map raw moves only one half.
The compiled atom then finds no entry, and `render_engine_answer` falls to its
`[no extraction backing]` branch — which drops the source count, every backing
source path, and the `[stale: source missing]` marker for a fact that has all
three. For a provenance tool, losing a source is worse than showing it twice.

So both sides key on `common.engine_atom_key` / `common.fold_atom_triple`.
