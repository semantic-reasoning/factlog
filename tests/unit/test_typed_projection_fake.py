"""Engine-independent coverage of the typed-projection insert loop (#126).

`_project_typed_relations(session, specs, accepted)` is the pure-Python core of
run_wirelog()'s typed-relation side-projection: it touches the session only via
intern()/insert(), never step()/close(). That lets these tests drive it with a
FakeSession that merely RECORDS inserts — no pyrewire, no engine, no monkeypatch,
no path globals. They pin the projection contract: which
(alias, intern(subject), scalar) tuples reach session.insert(), that a non-parsing
object is skipped + warned (the fact still loads untyped), that the scalar is a
bare int (never interned), and that the deterministic (relation, subject, object)
sort is load-bearing.

The pyrewire-gated e2e in test_typed_projection.py stays the authority on real
engine inference; this file owns the pure projection logic.
