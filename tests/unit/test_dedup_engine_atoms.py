"""Regression tests for dedup_engine_atoms triple collapse (#191).

The same (subject, relation, object) accepted from several sources must become
a single engine atom so accepted.dl / ask / run_logic_check use set semantics
(one row, true count) instead of an inflated, duplicated count. The collapse is
first-occurrence stable (not sort-min) so accepted.dl stays byte-identical when
the KB has no duplicate triple. Source aggregation lives on the separate
candidates path and is untouched.

Sameness is `common.engine_atom_key` — subject, relation, and object folded to
NFC (#342, #386). Two canonically equivalent spellings of one fact are one atom,
not two byte-different visually identical `relation(...)` lines. What
gets WRITTEN is still a row as authored: the group's composed-preferred member,
never a normalized synthesis, so a uniformly decomposed KB keeps its spelling.
