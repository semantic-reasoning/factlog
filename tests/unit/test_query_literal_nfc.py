"""A query constant meets a fact whatever unicode normal form each was authored in.

Subject/object comparisons route through ``common._canonical_value``; relation
names route through the NFC-only ``common.fold_relation_name``. An NFD-stored
relation or value — macOS text is routinely NFD — must meet an NFC-typed query
constant, while amount canonicalization must never merge relation predicates.

The chokepoint only covers a comparison that actually routes through it. Two relation-
name membership tests did not: the ``classify_query`` acceptance gate compared the raw
query name against the raw ``allowed_relations()`` names (in the ``relation`` branch and
in the ``count`` branch), and ``_relation_match_count`` compared a raw stored name against
the NFC alias keys. The gate ran first, so an NFD-stored relation queried in NFC was
turned away with QUERY_RELATION_NOT_ACCEPTED and never reached the folding match count.
Both now compare canonicalised values.

Scope note: ``path`` queries answer against the engine's interned pairs, a raw
comparison that does NOT pass through ``_canonical_value``; that engine-intern path is
a separate concern and is not covered here.
