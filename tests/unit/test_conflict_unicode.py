"""Unit tests for Unicode-normalization folding in conflict detection (#325).

``check_conflicts`` grouped only the *relation* axis under a Unicode fold. The
subject axis and the object axis used the raw string, so a KB that mixes NFC and
NFD spellings of the same text (routine on macOS, whose filesystem and IMEs emit
Hangul in NFD) failed in both directions at once:

* **subject axis, false negative (unsound)** — a real contradiction split into
  two singleton groups and the gate passed a KB that does contain one;
* **object axis, false positive** — two objects that render identically on
  screen were reported as a contradiction the reader cannot act on.

The object fold has to happen *before* ``literal_types.normalize``, not only on
the untyped fallback: an NFD-authored typed literal does not parse, degrades to
the ``"raw"`` tag, and never meets its NFC twin under ``"scalar"``.

Folding is NFC only — compatibility variants (fullwidth) and case stay distinct.
