# tests/test_conflicts.sh — single-valued contradiction detection + supersession (#30)
#
# Pins:
#   - a single-valued relation with 2 distinct objects for one subject = conflict
#   - marking the outdated row status='superseded' resolves it (non-destructive)
#   - a multi-valued (undeclared) relation with 2 objects is NOT a conflict
#   - no policy/single-valued.md => nothing to check (exit 0)
#   - 'superseded' rows survive merge and are excluded from accepted.dl
#   - validate.py accepts the 'superseded' status
#
# Deterministic; no pyrewire required.  Usage: bash tests/test_conflicts.sh
